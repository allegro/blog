# Intro

In a complex microservice system, we are not able to avoid problems. However, we can try to anticipate them and react to
them as quickly as possible. To achieve this, it is necessary to use specialized tools to assess the current condition
of our components. They are provided for by the microservice architecture model and implement one of its main
postulates- *Observability*.

# Observability

Let's try to answer ourselve, how the term *Observability* should be understood.

I would like to quote a very simple definition found on _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability)_

> Observability is the ability to collect data about program execution, internal states of modules, and communication
> between components.

The observable system provides precise data describing the condition of its components. This data can take many
forms-from numeric telemetry data to text records. Thanks to them, we are able to understand the characteristics of the
system behavior and the way of data flow. It allows us to catch subtle anomalies, that may not be a problem at this
moment, but they will become a problem soon. Effective developer intervention taken at this point of time allows
preserve system stability and reliability. And that this is what it's all about. We have the opportunity to act on the
cause before its negative effect occurs.
