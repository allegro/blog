# About the blog

This is Allegro’s public-facing tech blog. We use it to share our knowledge with the community and to tell others what our work at Allegro is like.
It is also a tool for promoting Allegro to potential candidates (PromoIT). However, we try to be objective, and we explicitly avoid any kind of excessive propaganda.
We write for smart people who are good at telling genuinely interesting and useful information from corporate BS.

The blog is hosted at [blog.allegro.tech](https://blog.allegro.tech/). We also cooperate with Allegro tech hub page [allegro.tech](https://allegro.tech/).

Goals:
* Creating a technical blog valuable for the community. We focus on development and devops.
* Letting the community know about events we organize or take part in.
* Maintaining the image of Allegro as a technical leader and a place where great engineers work.
* Highlighting our achievements but also describing our failures, for example by publishing outage postmortems.

Rules:
* We strive for high-quality posts (in both content and style).
* We publish in English.
* Posts must go through a review process.
* Blog’s editors decide on the order posts are published. They can also reject posts deemed not fit for the blog due to subject not matching the blog’s goals,
  low quality, inappropriate content, not following company policies, etc. In practice, this happens only very rarely.

# Where to get help

* This document
* Slack channel [#allegro-tech-blog](https://allegro.slack.com/archives/CG20RLTT2) — use `@redakcja` alias to tag the blog’s editors

# Core team

We encourage everyone to help with the blog, by becoming an author, helping with text reviews, and developing blog features.
However, there is a core team responsible for:

* the editorial process
* ensuring high quality
* encouraging others to publish on the blog
* promoting the blog outside the company
* planning and implementing new features

We treat the blog as a product and take it very seriously, but we are not a Scrum team, and we work on the project as time allows rather than full-time.

Currently, the team consists of:

* Daniel Dopierała — editor
* Bartosz Gałek — editor
* Tomek Gospodarczyk — editor
* Michał Kosmulski — editor-in-chief
* Mateusz Krzeszowiak — editor
* Wojtek Poniatowski — editor
* Katarzyna Zadurska — editor
