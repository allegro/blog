At some point in your career, you realize that it’s time to try to advance through the hierarchy. You think you are
doing a good job. You are constantly developing and learning something new. But at the same time, someone you know, with
much less experience and knowledge than you, has long been higher up the hierarchy than you. Then you ask yourself what is
wrong with me? In my case, the answer turned out to be a good gathering of expectations concerning my skills and work.
Below, you can read my insight about it. You will find out how you can steer your development, so that you become much
more valuable to your team, leader or company and how to combine all this, with your talents and interests.

### How to start the development

As a member of a project team, you want to deliver a fully valuable solution. The key to success is to discover what’s
behind the word valuable to your client. Is it enough to gather requirements? Unfortunately not. To find out you need to
use a prototyping method, such as an iterative [MVP](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (Minimum
Viable Product) approach. For example, you have to paint your daughter’s room. You have several choices. You can choose
the colour by yourself and paint the room without asking her for her opinion. There is a small chance that she will like
the colour. So you will make a non-compliant product. You can bring her a sampler and ask her to choose a colour. The
final colour when applied to the wall may turn out to be different and then the product will also not be as expected.
You can also ask her about the colour and buy a few samplers, paint a piece of wall with them and ask if any meet the
requirements, if yes then paint the whole room with the chosen colour, if not then buy another 5 colours and so on over
and over until you get it right. This is the MVP process. First you gather requirements, then you prototype, which means
you make a real product. You present it and receive feedback (you learn) and decide what to do next. You repeat this
process until you meet the client’s expectations. This approach gives you the assurance that you have done exactly what
was needed. Imagine that your skills and the work you do is a product. We already know that to make a valuable product
you need to gather requirements and prototype with the client. Your customer who cares most about your work and skills
is the team, the leader and the company you work for. However, what you do must also suit you. If you want your work and
your knowledge to be of value to them, you need to gather their requirements first. Then quickly show the result and
make sure it’s what they wanted. Are you probably wondering what this prototyping is for in the case of your work? You
have done some work, it has been accepted and what is there to talk about. There could be lots of reasons, you could
have spent too much time on it, it’s even possible that what you did is wrong. You would have to put in a huge amount of
time and work to improve it, which is why it was accepted as it is. Without prototyping for you, your work will appear
to be of good quality and in reality the team may not be happy with it. Let’s start with requirements gathering.
Unfortunately it is impossible to gather universal requirements for a given position, these requirements are different
in different companies and even teams. The same person who has certain skills and performs a certain way of work may be
a senior in one company where in another he or she may be a junior. In one of the companies I worked for, a good
programmer was required to know the products and the business, then it was important, for example, the length of
seniority and being a support for the business. Performing a large number of tasks was not so important. In another
company there were people who knew their product very well and were an excellent support to the business. However, they
did not perform their tasks on time and did not take on issues that required them to take on a lot of responsibility.
They still had junior or mid-level status.

This begs the question: how do I gather my skills requirements?

### Assess yourself with some evaluation sheets

At Allegro, in the case of programmers and testers, we have a list of expectations prepared within the leadership
community. With such a list, it is much easier to collect requirements and talk about your own development towards
promotion (in the team or in the company). In my case, it looked like after working at Allegro for a while, I decided
that it might be a good idea to finally get my development on track. My leader asked me to assess myself using a
requirements sheet. This allowed me to identify the current stage I was at. The same sheet about me was completed by my
leader. Then we calibrated ourselves. This sheet is divided into 3 main parts:

* Technical knowledge
* Attitude
* Product knowledge

Each part has a list of skills, which has an extensive description. For example, one of the descriptions of technical
knowledge looked like this:

* You know your technological stack very well (systems, applications, languages, tools) Having a given technical problem
  you know what are the technological abilities, and you know how to use them to achieve your goal.

I rated each skill on a scale of 1 to 5. Ideally, I would like each skill to be close to a 5. If I rated myself
somewhere at a 4 and my leader rated me a 3 during calibration, I found out that the requirements for that skill were
different from I thought. He said there were things I hadn’t used yet. To have a 4 at this point I need to know them
e.g. Cassandra database. With that I learned the first relevant requirement that I didn’t know about. After the whole
process of gathering requirements in this way, I already knew what I needed to work on. Now all I had to do was select a
few of them and start working. But how to choose those requirements, which I will implement with passion and actually do
them well?

### How to choose skills to improve?

There are many strategies on how to choose skills to develop. All in all, you need to use the right method for the right
type of skill to get a good result. The first step is to get a mentor. Usually it will be your leader, but it can also
be an experienced team member e.g. senior. Leaders in Allegro gain their development knowledge from many available
training sessions. You should find a similar person in your environment. Such a person will help you on your way and
will simulate your product customer that you will be making. Show him a list of things you should develop. Ask him,
which are the most important for your team. It is possible that the list of things will become very short. Now just pick
2 or 3 things and prepare prototypes. You can choose them intuitively or match them with your talents. Just take a
Gallup test (CliftonStrengths) to discover your talents. This test will help you choose a strategy for developing a
particular skill. This test will work well for soft skills. For hard skills
a [lean startup strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) may be better. Below are two examples of how this
can look in practice.

### How Gallup test can help you find activities that improve you

The Gallup test [CliftonStrengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/home.aspx)
helps you find activities that you naturally enjoy doing. The test result is divided into 4 main domains :

* Executing
* Influencing
* Relationship Building
* Strategic Thinking

Some of these will have a direct impact on your work, others will not. For example a description of your character in
the context of building relationships with people will be interesting information and will certainly raise your
awareness but will not help us in our challenge. Other talents that come out of the challenge may fit into the skill you
are developing or show how you should develop it. Of course with these talents, the knowledge itself that you have a
talent, does not immediately translate into skills, for example if it comes out that you have a talent for standing on
your head does not mean that you will immediately stand on your head. You have to develop this talent, and probably you
are already doing similar things because you simply have a talent for it, and you enjoy it. So the gallup test shows the
things you should focus on. They are so generic that you can easily match them to your problems.
![Gallup](/img/articles/2021-07-23-become-a-senior/gallup.png)
What it looked like in my case. I did the Gallup test, and it came out that I am a learner. I like to learn, and I should
share knowledge - which should make me happy. Comparing this talent to the list of skills I should develop, I found out
that I don’t share knowledge with others. I decided that a good form of knowledge transfer is to make presentations. I
completed training in making presentations. Thanks to this I had everything, talent and knowledge. I also estimated the
time for preparation and set a deadline. While preparing, I realized that this knowledge sharing strategy was not for
me. I finished this presentation and decided to change my knowledge sharing strategy. Quite a change in strategy is
called a pivot. I discussed the problem with my mentor and decided to make a pivot towards writing articles. Being in
this situation you have two choices: either you do a pivot, which means you change your strategy, or you take a persevered,
which means you continue to develop using your current strategy of course after getting proper feedback from your mentor
and team. Let us now look at the second type of skill.

### How startup method can help you develop your skills

Let us divide hard skills into two groups. In the first group there are skills you acquire while learning by yourself,
e.g. a new programming language. For this you need internal motivation and discipline to achieve the expected high
level. The second group is the one where you acquire skills automatically e.g. you use some framework in your project.
For the first group you can use the startup method.
![Startup](/img/articles/2021-07-23-become-a-senior/startup.png)
An example scenario of what the process of developing hard skills might look like:

1. Choose one skill with your mentor. (The order does not matter) additionally collect the requirements.
2. Estimate how long it will take you to develop that skill. Put it on your calendar.
3. Together with your mentor, set a first stage, i.e. the first prototype of your work and work on it for e.g. 2-3
   weeks.
4. After this time, show what you have done to your mentor or the whole team.
5. Draw conclusions. Collect feedback. Do you like doing it? Did the result meet their expectations?
6. If not, make a pivot to another strategy or take another skill, if so, improve what you collected during the feedback
   and keep developing.

In the worst case scenario you will go through all the skills. You will then have a fairly broad knowledge base. I have
never heard the opinion that someone learned something and now regrets it. In a positive scenario you will probably find
something you do well and enjoy it.

We will now look at the second group of skills, which you develop automatically while working on a project. Here again,
you should first consult with your mentor on the best strategy to follow. There are two strategies in such cases: to
gain deep knowledge in one of these skills or to learn a little about all of them. The mentor should know what the
team expects from the specialist in the given position. This automatically affects the implementation of the tasks in
the project:

1. You perform tasks only in the domain you know and after some time you become a specialist in this area, you do not
   take tasks from another domain that is new to you. Your value is the speed of task completion.
2. You always take tasks from a new domain, you are brave and not afraid of challenges. You will then have a broad
   general knowledge of all products but will complete tasks much more slowly.

This is just one example. It is important that the mentor is clear about his requirements and that he gives you feedback
after you have done a few of these tasks to make sure that this is what you wanted.

### Pivot or persevere

Finally, let me explain the startup terms for pivot. The term pivot means to change from one strategy to another. For
example, I did one pivot during my development process. I was developing the skill of knowledge sharing. I had several
strategies to choose from:

* Making presentations
* Writing articles
* Training preparation

I made a presentation and after collecting feedback I had to make a `pivot` and changed my strategy to another one. I
chose to share knowledge by writing articles. This article is the result of that. If this strategy works for me then I
will do a `preserve` and continue using the chosen strategy.

### Summary

If you feel that you should already be in a higher position it is likely that your job expectations are quite different
from you think. To change this you should first find a mentor and then gather their requirements. A good place to start
is with a list of requirements or a list of skills to start talking to your mentor about. From this list you should
select a few skills and then choose appropriate strategies for their development. To make it easier for you to choose a
strategy, do a talent test. Additionally, you can use the startup mvp approach. Ultimately, the key to success is to
gather requirements from your leader, team or entire company and then show the results as quickly as possible. If the
chosen skill or strategy doesn’t suit you or the feedback collected is strongly constructive don’t worry, make a pivot
and choose something else. After a few iterations you will definitely achieve your goal.
