The attack on Ukraine has shocked the entire world, but in Poland it is perceived as especially poignant.
Not only is Ukraine our direct neighbor (as are Russia and Belarus), but Poland’s difficult history allows us to
sympathize with the Ukrainians even more. Many live in Poland, so it’s affecting people we know personally.

While the fighting continues, here’s what [Allegro](https://allegro.tech) is doing, and what you can do, too, to help
humanitarian efforts.

* If you know any Ukrainians, your coworkers in particular, talk to them and show your support. Even minor gestures are
  important. Ask directly what kind of help they might need rather than trying to guess.
* Do not marginalize Russians and Belarussians. People are not the same as their governments, and often do not support
  their states’ actions.
* Work with your HR people and consider what kind of help you can offer as a company. Some examples would be extra days
  off, legal and financial support for bringing families to safety, or offering psychological support.
* Ask if the company can [donate directly, make donations by others easier](https://spolecznosc.allegro.pl/t5/blog/wsparcie-dla-ukrainy-co-mo%C5%BCesz-zrobi%C4%87-na-allegro-aby-pom%C3%B3c/ba-p/334998) [PL],
  provide means of communication, etc., depending on the industry.
* On a personal level, consider supporting one of the trustworthy humanitarian organizations. You can support them
  with cash, volunteer work, or donate necessary items which are being collected in most cities.
  Be extremely cautious of fake fundraising campaigns that are popping up on every fundraising platform. Carefully
  check the fundraiser.
* If you work in tech, you are likely an authority on IT matters for your family and friends. Make them aware of
  the issue of disinformation, and encourage them to use only reliable information sources. Due to the threat of
  cyberattacks, encourage them to upgrade their systems and make backups.
* You might also be able to [apply your tech skills directly](https://www.techtotherescue.org/tech/tech-for-ukraine).
* Regardless of how the situation develops, its consequences will last for years. Do not stop with one-off actions,
  and keep on providing help as necessary.
