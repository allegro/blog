[Big Data Spain](http://bigdataspain.org/2014/) is an annual conference on Big Data and related topics held in the
suburbs of Madrid. This year’s, i.e. third, edition has so far been the biggest; it has attracted more than 500 guests
and various speakers including Big Data celebrities like Paco Nathan of Databricks. During two days of the conference,
guests could attend many keynotes, speeches and workshops and learn about variuos products, services and specific
use-cases, in both English and Spanish. Allegro was represented by two employees with a presentation on Hadoop pitfalls
and gotchas.

### “State of Play”

Sean Owen of Cloudera and Paco Nathan, both experienced engineers and data scientists, shared their views on the current
state of the art as well as the past and future of computing. Paco Nathan devoted [his
speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTsRKJ4s0jY) to past and current “turning points” like abandoning “classic” SQL
databases, the golden era of functional programming, algebra and discrete mathematics in now omnipresent distributed
environments, the rise of so-called “notebooks”: collaborative, cloud-based tools focused on developing processes, cloud
computing itself (including the new “containerization” trend).

Sean Owen focused on [how to process and analyze data on a large scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySLGx-ULixU),
how the worlds of analysts and engineers differ and why they should meet in order to best leverage their data. Two, so
far very distant areas start to finally converge thanks to recent developments which fill the gap between them. It is
worth noting that both lecturers consider MapReduce obsolete and advertise [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) as
the future of Big Data.

### Allegro team

Allegro Group employees Jarosław Grabowski and Jacek Juraszek shared their experience with working with Hadoop
ecosystem. Their [talk titled “Pitfalls of storing and processing data in
Hadoop”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeA_ieuSs7E) included a variety of practical “dos and don'ts” presented side by
side with multiple Big Data aspects: data ingestion, processing, monitoring and storage. The presentation was well
received by the audience and started many discussions in the lobby.

### Other talks

An Amazon representative showed the advantages of using their cloud solutions, while Toby Woolfe of IBM gave a clear,
systematic [talk about collaboration between Big Blue and General
Motors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0xr1R6Iqpc) in terms of data mining. He also showed how Big Data tools and
technologies meet traditional, non-IT business and help to earn what every company appreciates: money. An interesting
use-case of Big Data analysis helping to track down car defects was presented.

[Stratio](http://www.stratio.com/), the third main sponsor was omnipresent. Stratio’s CEO Óscar Méndez [played the role
of the host](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ew-CUH93A4) of the whole event while Stratio engineers showed two
Spark-based products, Stratio Streaming and Stratio Crossdata, in two separate workshops in Spanish.

Dr Jim Webber introduced [Neo4J](http://neo4j.com/), a graph-oriented database management system. During an excellent
and humorous [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb1LREH9EKk) and
[workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQyffPSWJk), English researcher showed why a graph-oriented database is an
excellent choice for certain classes of problems and sketched a quick, but impressive example of retail recommendations.
Another fun talk was given by Jordan Tigani of Google. He presented Google Big Data toolset and used it for Machine
Learning on a football (“soccer”, as he called it) example: predicting the results of football matches. Tigani conducted
the [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Uag3C1RFMQ) using a “notebook”, confirming Paco Nathan's point on
this emerging tool. Make sure you take a look at [IPython](http://ipython.org/), an implementation of this idea.

Cloudera’s Enrico Berti introduced a popular Hadoop web interface, i.e. [Hue](http://gethue.com/). Enrico gave a quick
[presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyDSP6OguKQ) of the key features of Hue and then showed how Hue converts
otherwise cumbersome Hadoop interaction into a series of quick and easy steps, while his coworker Gwen Shapira completed
the topic of pitfalls in her technical [talk on benchmarking issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEWMPuOorW4).

### Closing remarks

The conference, although well organized in a spacious multiplex cinema, is rather a medium-sized event. While it still
can’t compete with giants like Strata, it is certainly worth looking at next year. All the presentations are available
on [Big Data Spain YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/BigDataSpain).
