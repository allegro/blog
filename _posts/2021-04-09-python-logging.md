This post is also about small (yet useful) library that has been released in opensource: [LogExtraCtx]

## Why did I write this library?

I'm a big fan of logging. I'm also a fan of logging as much extra data as possible, and I'm 
a fan of `logging.debug` entries. 

I'm also a fan of the DRY approach. I feel strong anxiety when I see repetition in code. 
And my mind literally hangs when I need to do `Ctrl-C/V`, even if it's justified by 
circumstances. In such cases, I start to focus on getting rid of copypastes instead of
how to write functionality.

Combining all these „passions” is not always easy. It's hard to log everything, without
repeating things. Even if it's possible, it usually leads to inelegant code. 

Eg, if I want to log that some error happened: 

```python
logger.error('Foo happened: %s', e)
```

So far it's clean and easy.
But wait, it would be nice to add some extra details, like `user`
(then you could search by `user` in [Kibana], if your logs goes there):


```python
logger.error('Foo happened: %s', e, extra={'user': user,
                                           'action_type': 'bar'})
```


Next, during debugging of some problem, you notice that it's not nearly enough and it's worth
adding some `logging.debug`

```python
logger.debug("We're going to do SOMETHING in thread",
             extra={'user': user,
                    'action_type': 'bar',
                    'thread_num': thread_num})
```

And you notice that you have copied `user` and `action_type` in `extra=` dictionary. 
It's a Bad Thing!. Imagine what would happen if there were another `logger.debug`, and another? 
Lots of repeated code, which should be written only once ....

![I see copypastes in code](https://i.imgflip.com/54peqd.jpg)

So in other words, the more details you log, the more cumbersome the code. What can we
do?

### Method 1: don't log `extra`

It's not what I like. I **do** want to log them!

### Method 2: store `extra` in a variable

It's what I used to use sometimes, before [LogExtraCtx]. It could be something like that:

```python
extra = {'user': user, 'action_type': 'bar'}

logger.debug("We're going to do SOMETHING in thread",
             extra=dict(thread_num=thread_num, **extra))

logger.error('Foo happened: %s', e, extra=extra)
```

Quite tricky, but not very elegant. 

### Method 3: use [LogExtraCtx]

Before I describe the aforementioned library, let me show you a more realistic example.

Consider the following code:

```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def send_message(requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:
    """ Function send_message sends message to the specified recipient.  """
    try:
        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},
                          ... < other params > ....)
        r.raise_for_status()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logger.error('Sending message failed. Response text: "%s"', e,
                     extra={   # extra data to be indexed
                         'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',
                         'requester': requester,
                         'recipient': recipient,
                     })
        return False
    logger.info('Sending MSG success.',
                extra={  # the same extra data to be indexed
                    'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',
                    'requester': requester,
                    'recipient': recipient,
                })
    return True
```

There are two log entries, both with extra data for easy-finding in Kibana (There is a bit
of redundancy in the code,  so I already feel the desire to DRY it). 

Then I need to need to add additional logging:

```python
logger.debug("headers=%r", r.result.headers,
             extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',
                    'requester': requester,
                    'recipient': recipient
                    })
```

And then, I need even more context in every log entry:

```python
extra = {'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',
         'requester': requester,
         'recipient': recipient,
         'user': str(request.user),
         'environment': env_type,
         }
```

Combined all together, it becomes a big unreadable blob of code. Very simple logic has been 
spoiled by 3 log entries. 

```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def send_message(environment: str, requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:
    """ Function send_message sends MSG to the specified recipient.  """
    try:
        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},
                          ... < other params > ....)
        r.raise_for_status()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logger.error('Sending MSG failed. Response text: "%s"', e,
                     extra={   # extra data to be indexed
                         'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',
                         'requester': requester,
                         'recipient': recipient,
                         'user': str(request.user),
                         'environment': env_type,
                     })
        logger.debug("headers=%r", r.result.headers,
                     extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',
                            'requester': requester,
                            'recipient': recipient,
                            'user': str(request.user),
                            'environment': env_type,
                            })
        return False
    logger.info('Sending MSG success.',
                extra={  # the same extra data to be indexed
                    'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',
                    'requester': requester,
                    'recipient': recipient,
                    'user': str(request.user),
                    'environment': env_type,
                })
    return True
```

#### My solution — *LogExtraCtx*:

To use it, just replace `logging.getLogger`  with  `getLogger` from `logextractx.logger`,
and then create local logger with local context:

```python
from logextractx.logger import getLogger
logger = getLogger(__name__)
[...]
loclogger = logger.local(extra={'DATA_IN': 'CURRENT_CONTEXT})
```

so the previous example is reduced to the following clean code:


```python
from logextractx.logger import getLogger
logger = getLogger(__name__)


def send_message(environment: str, requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:
    """ Function send_message sends MSG to the specified recipient.  """

    # extra data to be indexed
    loclogger = logger.local(extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',
                                    'requester': requester,
                                    'recipient': recipient,
                                    'user': str(request.user),
                                    'environment': env_type})

    try:
        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},
                          ... < other params > ....)
        r.raise_for_status()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        loclogger.error('Sending MSG failed. Response text: "%s"', e)
        loclogger.debug("headers=%r", r.result.headers)
        return False
    loclogger.info('Sending MSG success.')
    return True
```


## Interesting and useful „side effect”

Usually it's hard to distinguish log entries from various users. Eg. if you have error in
your code and you find `IndexError`,  you cannot be **really sure** to which request does it
belong. 

Of course, you can guess, based on chronology and based on many other symptoms,
but if you have many concurrent requests, then it's hard or even impossible to associate `ERROR` log
with previous `INFO` or `DEBUG`.

So it's nice to have some kind of tracking ID (`request-id`), which glues to request when it come to
your application and accompany to him until the end of request processing. It's also nice
to have `session-id` attached to all requests which belongs to given HTTP session. 

To use it in your [Django] project, you should use the following:

* append `logextractx.middleware.LogCtxDjangoMiddleware` to your `MIDDLEWARE` in settings: 
```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    [...]
     'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    [...]
    'logextractx.middleware.LogCtxDjangoMiddleware',
 ]
```

And instead of `logextractx.logger` use `logextractx.middleware` so:    

```python
from logextractx.logger import getLogger
logger = getLogger(__name__)
[...]
```

Also, you need to add filter into logging
```python
    'filters': {
        'RidFilter': {
            '()': 'logextractx.middleware.RidFilter'
        }
    }
```

And that's all. Now every log entry will contain `request-id` and `session-id` fields,
which looks so nice in kibana:

## Extra Formatter

If you use plain logging format, instead of Kibana + JSON formatter, then you may be interested in using
`logextractx.formatter.ExtraFormatter`.  Just add following in your formatter definition (DictConfig):

```python
        'formatters': {
            'simple': {
                '()': 'logextractx.formatter.ExtraFormatter',
                'fmt': '%(levelname)s %(asctime)s %(name)s: %(message)s [%(extras)s]'
            }
        }
```

And then you will have all extra in single log line.

## Conclusion

Logging lot of details is good, but if it leads to breaching DRY approach, I encourage you
to use *LogExtraCtx*.
