Everyone repeats like a mantra that tests are an indispensable element of development work. Is there anything to it?
Well, I need to admit that as a developer, I rather often want to skip the test writing stage. I assume I’m not the
only one. I’m aware that it’s a mistake, even with testers on board. Effective and efficient testing of your own
code can help with catching bugs in new functionalities, as well as in changes to already existing ones. It cannot
be questioned. Sometimes tests also help to understand how some long-unused functionality or component works. And
that’s a small bonus too. **Can a large project cope without testing? Probably so. But the number of errors and
their severity will probably be much higher.** That’s why in Allegro Ads we pay attention to writing tests.

## Frameworks
We have a fairly large number of frameworks that are used to write tests in JavaScript. We can list tools like:
[MochaJS](https://mochajs.org/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io),
[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). However, in this article, we will pay
special attention and compare two javascript testing libraries: [Enzyme.js](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/)
and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) (often called RTL).

## EnzymeJS
From the Enzyme documentation we can read a short description:

> Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output.
> You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime given the output.

Enzyme was released in **2015 by AirBnB**. And let’s face it, Enzyme has gained a lot of popularity. Last year, the
library was moved from AirBnB space to external Github space as a separate independent organization. This step was
intended to encourage the community to further develop the library.

When it comes to raw data, the latest version of **Enzyme 3.11.0** has a bundle size of **463.2kB minified (127.5 kB
minified + gzipped)** and was released on **20 December 2019**. Currently it has 258
[open issues](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme/issues) and 31 open PR’s.

Interesting fact:
- There are also Enzyme Adapter Packages for React. So you need to install adapter package and its dependencies
related to the version of React that you are using. For example, for version 16, it also needs
`enzyme-adapter-react-16` to be installed. Unfortunately, it does not support all features completely.
It should be mentioned that there is not offical adapter for React 17 yet, which has been released in
October 2020 (so it is more than a year!). If you don't want to use community version you are still blocked and you
cannot use the new React features.

## React Testing Library (often called RTL)
RTL says about itself:

> The React Testing Library is a very light-weight solution for testing React components. It provides light utility
 functions on top of `react-dom` and `react-dom/test-utils`, in a way that encourages better testing practices.

Released in **April 2018 by Kent C. Dodds**. The latest stable version **12.1.2** of RTL has a bundle size of **215.8kB
minified (47.3kB minified + gzipped)** . The RTL repository has 26
[open issues](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme/issues) and 2 open PR’s.

Interesting facts:
- When you create a project by Create React App, you will get support for React Testing Library right away.
- Jest documentation links to the RTL website in the
[*Testing Web Framework*](https://jestjs.io/docs/testing-frameworks#react) section as well as React documentation in
the [*Recommended Tools*](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html#tools).
- Testing library allows us to test with the same API not only React but also other frameworks like Vue
(`testing-library/vue`), Angular (`testing-library/angular`), Svelte (`testing-library/svelte`) etc. This could bring
some advantage for people working on several projects in different technologies. There is also
`dom-testing-library` which allows writing tests without any framework!

## Basic differences

The main differences between the two libraries that I can notice:
1. **Different approaches to testing**

What distinguishes RTL is that we find elements by their labels or texts, almost like a user would. The point is to
replicate and simulate the user’s behavior. RTL renders components to the DOM and doesn’t give us access
directly to the component's internals. While Enzyme uses shallow rendering (or sometimes deep rendering) and
encourages us to test the components instance using its state and props. Enzyme also allows full rendering of DOM
but it is not the basic assumption of the library’s operation.
2. **Age**

Enzyme is 6 years old, RTL is 3 years old

## Comparison of downloads

Below we can see a comparison of the number of downloads of both libraries in the last 5 years. Between August and
September 2020, the number of RTL downloads exceeded the number of Enzyme downloads.

*Source [npm trends](https://www.npmtrends.com/@testing-library/react-vs-enzyme)*

In the case of RTL, it is clear that the number of downloads is still growing strongly. On the other hand, it can be
suspected that the highest peak of Enzyme downloads is already behind.

## Reasons to change the testing library

Well, let’s be honest, Enzyme.js is a powerful library which has helped us test our React Components in an easier way
for a long time. But maybe... too long? The first official release was in December 2015. Do not get me wrong, I don’t
want to say that everything old is bad. But the frontend world is changing constantly, just as the approach to
testing it. I know that the Enzyme.js library hasn’t been deprecated yet, but there are a lot of reasons to switch
your test library right now. **If you haven’t read it I highly recommend you to take a look at
[this article](https://www.piotrstaniow.pl/goodbye-enzyme) by Piotr Staniów** (it takes about 10 minutes to read).

The main reasons for me to think about slowly rewriting my tests and switching to another library from this article
are:
- one developer maintaining the entire Enzyme package,
- not keeping up with React changes.

If you ask me, these are big blockers in using this tool.

## Case study of rewriting

Below I will present my own example created for the purposes of this article. It should present the minimal effort to
rewrite tests from one library to another.

### Component:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export const Test = ({ defaultCounter = 0, header = 'Default header' }) => {
    const [counter, setCounter] = useState(defaultCounter)
    const increment = () => setCounter(counter + 1)
    const decrement = () => setCounter(counter - 1)

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{header}</h1>
            <p className='counter'>{counter}</p>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment counter</button>
            <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement counter</button>
        </div>
    )
};

```

### Enzyme example:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { mount } from 'enzyme';

import { Test } from '../Test';

describe('<Test />', () => {
  it('should render default header', () => {
    // when
    const wrapper = mount(<Test />);

    // then
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('Default header');
  });

  it('should render header from props', () => {
    // when
    const wrapper = mount(<Test header="My simple calculator" />);

    // then
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('My simple calculator');
    expect(wrapper.text()).not.toContain('Default header');
  });

  it('should render default defaultCounter', () => {
    // when
    const wrapper = mount(<Test />);

    // then
    expect(wrapper.find('.counter').text()).toBe('0');
  });

  it('should render defaultCounter from props', () => {
    // when
    const wrapper = mount(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);

    // then
    expect(wrapper.find('.counter').text()).toBe('100');
  });

  it('should increment counter on click', () => {
    // given
    const wrapper = mount(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);
    const button = wrapper.find('button').at(0);

    // when
    button.simulate('click');

    // then
    expect(wrapper.find('.counter').text()).toBe('101');
  });

  it('should decrement counter on click', () => {
    // given
    const wrapper = mount(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);
    const button = wrapper.find('button').at(1);

    // when
    button.simulate('click');

    // then
    expect(wrapper.find('.counter').text()).toBe('99');
  });
});
```

### What needs to be changed:
- remove `mount` and use `render` instead
- remove `wrapper` variable and use `screen` to get elements
- replace `simulate(’click’)` with `userEvent`

### React Testing Library example:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

import { Test } from '../Test';

describe('<Test />', () => {
  it('should render default header', () => {
    // when
    render(<Test />);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Default header' })).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should render header from props', () => {
    // when
    render(<Test header="My simple calculator" />);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { name: 'My simple calculator' })).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.queryByText('Default header')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should render default defaultCounter', () => {
    // when
    render(<Test />);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByText('0')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should render defaultCounter from props', () => {
    // when
    render(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByText('100')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should increment counter on click', () => {
    // given
    render(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);

    const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Increment counter' });

    // when
    userEvent.click(button);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByText('101')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should decrement counter on click', () => {
    // given
    render(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);

    const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Decrement counter' });

    // when
    userEvent.click(button);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByText('99')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});

```

## Enzyme and RTL in Allegro Ads

My team is currently working on the development of [Allegro Ads](https://allegro.pl/ads), which is an advertising tool
for our e-commerce platform sellers. It is a whole panel for viewing statistics, displaying advertising campaigns. We
provide sponsored offers for our Allegro site, Facebook, Google and recently even the partner websites. Our sellers
pay us for the opportunity to advertise their products, and at the same time we strive to ensure that these ads
accurately reach people potentially interested in buying, thereby generating profits for sellers.

The main technology stack is standard and still pretty cool. The core of the project is written in React, and
significant parts have been rewritten to TypeScript. For testing purposes, we use Jest. In my opinion this is a very
good and stable tool, easy to work with. It has quite a low entry barrier, even if someone hasn’t had too much
experience with tests before. The main advantages of Jest for me are minimal configuration and quite good
documentation. But for testing React components we currently have two libraries and I’ll explain why in a moment.

The 2.0 version of platform Allegro Ads was released about 6 years ago. A year ago
the team added React Testing Library to `package.json`. We have both packages so far. **Recently we officially
decided to slowly rewrite the Enzyme tests and get rid of the library for good.** We added the rule to our
Declaration of Code Convention that the new components are tested just in RTL, the old ones will be rewritten
during the development of specific parts.

## Migration effects so far

Currently we have got **592 test files** (counting after the file names with “spec” phrase). In these files we can also
find **709 of unique “describe”** usage, and **1796 unique test cases**. Half of tests
are written only in Jest, but a significant number of tests for better testing use extra libraries.

React Testing Library is used in **131 files**, which is around **22% of all test files**.
Enzyme tests are in **137 files** which is around **23%**.

So Enzyme is still used more often. However, keep in mind that we have been using Enzyme in this project from the
beginning and RTL for a year. So I’m quite stunned by these numbers. I did not think that the use of RTL would
increase so significantly in a year. Of course, there is still a long way to completely eliminate Enzyme, especially
among other project priorities, but now I’m convinced that small steps will be enough to do that.

## Summary

Hopefully this article showed you that switching from one library to another doesn’t have to be difficult. As
programmers, we will encounter such situations frequently. I think that the effort put into replacing old libraries
with newer ones and keeping your code free of technological debt will bring tangible results for developers, project
and, finally, users.

I hope that I was able to show you why we rewrite the Enzyme tests to RTL, how we do it and what stage we are at.
Probably it is not the end. What are we going to replace RTL with in the future? We’ll see. :)
