At Allegro we try to take advantage of all opportunities to learn something new and to share our knowledge with others.
So far, we’ve held a number of internal conferences and meetings, and you may have seen our employees talk at JUGs and
conferences such as [Devoxx PL](http://devoxx.pl/) or [Confitura](http://www.confitura.pl/).

Now, we want to share our internal meetings with you. We plan to organize a series of talks held by well-known
and appreciated IT people from around the world, whom we call IT Stars.

The guests we want to invite will be carefully selected, acknowledged experts in their fields.

Meetings will be open and held several times a year interchangeably in various cities of our operations,
i.e. Poznań, Toruń, Warsaw, Kraków and Wrocław.

The Stars’ visits will be a great opportunity not only to listen to their presentations, but also to grab a beer
and to talk to other engineers in a loose atmosphere.

For a good start, on August 10th join us for the first meeting whose guest IT Star will be Martin Thompson,
a Java expert from UK.

Martin has over two decades of experience building complex and high-performance computing systems. He is most recently known
for his work on [Aeron](https://github.com/real-logic/Aeron) and [SBE](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding).
Previously at [LMAX](http://www.lmax.com/) he was the co-founder and CTO when he created the
[Disruptor](https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor).
Prior to LMAX Martin worked for [Betfair](http://www.betfair.com/), three different content companies wrestling
with the world largest product catalogues, and was a lead on some of the most significant C++ and Java systems of the 1990s
in the automotive and finance domains.

The meeting will be streamed for those of you who can’t attend the live event in Warsaw. Check out the
