Hi, I am Magda and I will tell you a story about coming back to work after 21 months and 2 days break. Everything here will be a subjective perspective about my experience.

Maybe you are planning a one year trip around the world? Maybe you will have a longer medical break? Or maybe just like me, you come back after maternity leave. I think that all these stories could be quite similar. Let’s check how it was.

## My first month
### First week -mix excitation and fear
You're happy to be back, but at the same time you wonder what it'll be like. It's normal to be afraid. The first days are spent on doing OSH training, updating the system and applications to the latest versions. For half a week you struggle with access that you have lost in the meantime. ;-)

### Second week -only fear
Suddenly you realize how many things have changed, how many things you have to catch up on and how many things you have forgotten. It’s not a good feeling. This is the most difficult time because you usually confront your assumptions about returning with reality.

### Third week -light in the tunnel
You see that you are slowly getting over the technical problems, with little hints from the team, it turns out that you still remember most of the things. And you catch up on new things quickly. The work is accelerating and slowly giving the same satisfaction as before.

### Fourth week -feeling of relief
You take up your tasks, you get going, you're back in the game. Of course, you still need time to catch up, but it's not that bad. You start taking on bigger tasks, you write down your professional  goals, you take part in discussions on topics that you have already absorbed.

## Tips and thoughts
After such a long break from work, you will surely wonder what it's like to come back and whether you will be able to cope. You will feel a lot of stress. Maybe it's a good time to do something for yourself. Read a book about fighting stress, listen to an inspiring podcast, relieve your emotions by doing sports. You know yourself, you know what helps you and what doesn't. Try to relieve the tension so that you can come back with an open mind and willingness to take action. Enjoy your last moments.

### What is worth doing -company matters
1. One month before, remind the team leader that you are coming back. Ask him if there will be any integration being organized and declare your willingness to participate.
1. One week before coming back, ask your team leader and HR partner what documents or obligatory trainings like OSH you should sign or do first after coming back.
1. Unread all emails older than 2 months (I know that there is a willingness to read every single mail from 2 years, but really it's a waste of your time. You were gone, you can't change it, something you miss but you catch it up in work in the feature). Search only for every emails from your hr (it can be important)
1. Ask if to go for an onboarding for new employers (if your company organizes sth like that) and take part. You will catch up on company-wide backlogs and learn new company-wide tools and guidelines.
1. Read the documentation/team wiki -it helps you recall basic information.
1. Bring cake to your first day in the office with your colleagues. This will break the ice and will be a good sweet start. Your co-workers will thank me. ;-)

### What is worth doing -technical matters
1. Search Roadmaps for current year and read about things you don't know.
1. See the libraries that are now used in the project.
1. Ask for help! When you come back, start writing down the topics that you would like to catch up on or that you are not familiar with. Write down all your questions in one place. After a while, ask your team members to explain them.

## Which factors may impact a successful return to work
### Factors dependent on you:
* your attitude,
* no fear of asking questions,
* openness to new people who weren't in the company before, realize that now you are the new one,
* organization of your own work (no one will guide you, you have to take care of yours possible shortcomings!)

### Factors beyond our control:
* co-workers attitude and willingness to help,
* team leader attitude and your cooperations,
* changes in the company: what has been happening in the company during the time you wasn't there e.g. how much the processes has changed
* return time: In what period do you come? Hot? Or maybe a vacation? Maybe there's no one to take us in? Maybe it's better to come back, for example, in January than before the holidays when everyone is on leave.

## Summary
In retrospect, I can say that there is nothing wrong with taking a break from work. Many people have such breaks at work, especially women. Although let's be honest, returning after such a long time is a big challenge.

It would be nice if companies introduced onboarding for people after long breaks and put more emphasis on taking care of their affairs. So that they too can implement their duties as quickly as possible. Which is a win for both sides.

If you are coming back after a long break, enjoy your return to professional life. Remember that a break is not the end of the world. Keep your head up, do your thing. You don't even know how quickly you will find yourself in the old-new reality. After some time, you will start working as if nothing had ever changed.
