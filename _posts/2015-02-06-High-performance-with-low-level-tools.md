Even though a lot of software development is high-level stuff which does not require the developer to delve into the details of how things
work under the hood, in certain situations it can be very helpful to know what sort of low-level operations an application is performing.
Two typical scenarios are performance tuning and debugging.

Below you can find some tools which are already available or can be easily installed on most Linux and UNIX-like systems (e.g. using
apt-get) and which can help you with debugging, tracing and monitoring your application’s behavior. Using some of them requires root
access.
Most have a number of advanced features which are not covered here.

Interpreting the numbers these tools display is often a complex task and will not be explained here. Note that if you deploy your software
to virtual machines in the cloud, as we usually do at [Allegro](https://allegro.tech), interpretation of results becomes even harder than
with physical machines since there is always an additional level of indirection above the machine you can directly observe. Performance
tuning is quite complex, so explaining it is not the point of this post — I assume you already know the basics. The point is rather to
draw your attention to the fact that the tools described here exist at all. I would especially like to highlight [`strace`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/strace) which
can be helpful not only in performance tuning but also in common debugging situations. If you’re interested, you can find more
information in the man pages of the tools and on the Internet.

## CPU, memory and I/O load <a id="cpu-mem"></a>

### top and htop

Almost everyone uses [`top`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/top) to display processes’ CPU usage, but this tool can do much more.
First of all, pressing `h` key when the application is running will display help about available shortcuts. There are a lot of
useful features including a multi-window mode. Some of the interesting and little known shortcuts are:

* `z` to toggle color display.
* `<` and `>` to move the column by which entries are sorted to the left and to the right. Sorting is by CPU usage by
default. Pressing `x` toggles the highlighting of sort column. `M` sorts entries by memory usage.
* `c` to toggle display of processes’ full command line.
* `H` to display individual threads instead of processes.

Some options can be set on the command line as well. One example of a convenient command-line option is `-p` which starts
`top` with only specified processes visible. For example, to monitor process with PID 1234, you would run `top -p1234`.

A program called [`htop`](http://hisham.hm/htop/) is sometimes more convenient to use than regular top. It offers a text-mode UI with
color display by default and navigation shortcuts similar to [Midnight Commander (mc)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander).
It’s quite user friendly and highly customizable. It also offers a convenient process-tree view (`F5` or `t`). The shortcut
to display threads is `H` just as in top. Likewise, you can use `-p` command-line parameter to monitor only selected
processes.

While `top` is available on almost any Linux machine, `htop` usually needs to be manually installed using `apt-get` or another package
manager. If you like using `htop` or any other non-standard tool, and use [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) or another similar
configuration management utility, it may be convenient to add the corresponding packages to your manifests so that they are installed
automatically on any new machines you set up.

### iotop

If there’s `top` for monitoring CPU and memory usage, there’s also [`iotop`](http://guichaz.free.fr/iotop/) for monitoring
I/O activity (to be more precise: block device activity). While tools like `vmstat` or `iostat` (mentioned below) only show
the summary of input-output activity in the whole system, `iotop` allows you to quickly determine which process is causing this
activity. Useful keyboard shortcuts include:

* `a` (or `-a` command-line option) toggles accumulative mode. In this mode, total I/O performed since the start of
monitoring is displayed instead of current transfer rates.
* `o` (or `-o` command-line option) toggles the display of only processes which are performing I/O activity. Especially
useful in combination with `-a`.
* Left and right arrows change the column by which entries are sorted.

### vmstat

[`vmstat`](http://linux.die.net/man/8/vmstat) displays essential system activity statistics such as memory usage, CPU and
I/O activity, context switches, etc. Apart from the almost-obligatory refresh delay, useful command-line options include `-S M`
which switches memory display to use megabytes as unit and `-s` which dumps (just once) some interesting system statistics. With
recent kernel versions, `vmstat` can display a number of detailed I/O-related statistics thanks to `-d` and `-D`
options.

### iostat

[`iostat`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/iostat) displays detailed statistics about the system’s I/O activity and can be very helpful
in explaining why certain activities overload the machine’s disks while other apparently similar workloads can be handled just fine.
Command-line option `-m` causes megabytes to be used as the basic unit while `-x` turns on extended display. In extended
mode, not only transfer rates are displayed but also the number of operations as well as the number of merged operations and average wait
times, which are a measure of the disk controller’s performance.

The number of I/O operations that can be handled is one of the things that set solid-state (SSD) disks apart from traditional rotational
disks (HDD) and can often explain strange situations such as why a system is struggling to handle a 5 MB/s transfer. You can put a device
name on the command line in order to not mess up the display with data for disks which you are not interested in.

Unintuitively, on Debian and Ubuntu, `iostat` does not have a separate package and is installed using `apt-get` as part of
the `sysstat` package.

## System and library call tracing <a id="system-and-library"></a>

### strace

Suppose you just deployed your application to production environment but it seems to not be running and you don’t see any logs.
Such situations are more common when you send your logs from all machines to a central log server using tools such as
[logstash](http://logstash.net/) and [Kibana](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/), but can also happen when logging to local
files. Since your logging is dead, it may be difficult to learn what is going on,
and in particular, how to get logging back to work. Or for some reason you see in [Zabbix](http://www.zabbix.com/) / [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/)
that your host
is generating lots of network traffic but you don’t know why it is sending so much data, what data it is and where it's going. In such
cases, [`strace`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/strace) may come in handy.

Whenever an application needs to perform a task that uses some shared resource such as a filesystem or a network, it requests the Operating
System (OS) to handle the operation. Most such requests are handled by system calls, and `strace` is a tool which allows system
calls to be traced and logged. This makes it possible to directly view what data your application is sending over the network, when it
accesses the system clock or what files it opens. Note that a few operations are handled by the OS, but not through system calls. An
example would be accessing data on disk via [memory-mapped files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file): system calls are used
to map and unmap areas of a file, but individual accesses are handled by the [virtual memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory)
subsystem without the overhead that system calls introduce.

`strace` is a very powerful tool for analyzing the activity of applications, whether they be written by you or by someone else. It
can be used to start and trace a new application, or it can attach to an already-running application. For a simple use case, run
`strace ls` in order to execute `ls` under the control of `strace`. You will see a number of system calls printed, among
which you should be able to recognize calls such as `open`, `write` and `close` which handle file operations as well
as printing to standard output. To test the other mode, you can start some Java service on your machine, find its PID and run
`strace -p1234 -s1000 -f -t` (assuming the PID was 1234). You may be surprised at how many system calls are performed by a Java
application even when it is seemingly idle.

The command-line options of interest in the above example are:

* `-p` for attaching to a process with known PID (this usually requires root access even if you are the process owner),
* `-f` for tracing forked processes (including threads),
* `-t` for printing timestamps,
* `-s1000` for printing up to 1000 characters of the calls’ arguments.

Other useful options
include `-o` for saving output to a file and `-e` for filtering the system calls which you want to trace
(e.g. `-eread,write,sendto,recvfrom,open,close` is useful for debugging network traffic).

Note that by default, `strace` prints its output to standard error instead of standard output. This means that if you want to
search for data in the output, you need to either use `-o` to save it to a file first, or redirect stderr to stdout before piping
the result over to `grep`:

```
strace ls 2>&1 | grep 'write'
```

### ltrace<a id="ltrace"></a>

While `strace` traces system calls, [`ltrace`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/ltrace) can trace library calls. The libraries
mentioned here are of course not dependencies of your Java application, but rather system-level libraries such as the standard C library.
This tool is probably more useful for C developers than Java developers, but sometimes it can help in debugging issues or checking how
certain features are implemented (e.g. those related to synchronization or filesystem access). Command-line options and program behavior
are very similar to `strace`.

## Detailed I/O tracing <a id="detailed-i-o"></a>

### blktrace

When it comes to debugging block I/O activity, [`blktrace`](http://linux.die.net/man/8/blktrace) provides the most detailed
information. This powerful tool can record individual disk reads, writes and seeks so you get a very detailed view of what is happening
in the system. Since block layer activity is recorded directly, even I/O operations originating from memory-mapped files or otherwise
not cause by system calls, will be recorded.

Due to the huge amount of data produced, `blktrace` only creates a binary log of operations, and separate tools such as
[`blkparse`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/blkparse) and [`btt`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/btt) are used to display
the data in a human-readable format and analyze it. Tip: never store the log on the device you are analyzing or you’ll create a positive
feedback loop.

## Network and file descriptors<a id="network-and-file"></a>

### netstat

For debugging network-related issues, such as determining what clients are connected to your application or which application is blocking a port
and preventing your app from listening on it, [`netstat`](http://linux.die.net/man/8/netstat) is often the tool of choice.
This application can print open network connections as well as their states. A combination of options I often use is `netstat -telap`. This
combination displays information about TCP connections, with extended display, for all connections, including listening sockets and shows
program PIDs. The `l` flag is redundant due to presence of `a` but makes the set of flags easier to remember.

By default, `netstat` tries to display host names instead of IP addresses and replaces well-known port numbers with their
corresponding protocol names, e.g. `http` instead of 80. Sometimes this is confusing and may make searching through the
list harder since it is not always obvious which ports are in numeric form and which are replaced with descriptive names. Resolving host
names requires DNS queries and may make `netstat` slow. For this situation, `netstat` offers the `-n` flag (and
several more fine-grained others) which disables all human-friendly display names and shows only numeric ports and host addresses. Quite
often, using `-n` makes `netstat` much faster.

With `-s` flag, `netstat` prints a summary of system-wide statistics related to the network stack. This information can be
used to debug issues such as connection time-outs or resets.

### lsof<a id="lsof"></a>

[`lsof`](http://linux.die.net/man/8/lsof) stands for “list open files” and it displays open files, including sockets, pipes and
device special files (this is Linux / UNIX so [almost everything is a file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file)).
It can be used for similar purposes as `netstat` as well as for tracing what files an application is
using. Displaying UNIX pipes can sometimes help in debugging
[IPC (Inter-Process Communication)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) issues within a single machine.

## Hardware properties <a id="hardware-properties"></a>

### hdparm

[`hdparm`](http://linux.die.net/man/8/hdparm) can display lots of useful information about a disk drive when used with the
`-i` or `-I` flags. It can also read and set a number of advanced options, some of which are extremely dangerous.
`hdparm` can be used for smoke-testing your drive’s performance when run with the `-Tt` flags. While it is by no means a
real benchmark, it provides an approximation of the disk’s transfer rate (labelled *buffered disk reads*). If your new and shiny high-end
server shows a number lower than your laptop, expect something to be wrong with the system. The value *cached reads* can be used as an
approximation of memory and system bus speeds.

### lshw, lspci and lsusb<a id="lsxxx"></a>

There are a number of `lsXYZ` programs for listing different kinds of resources in a system. For learning about hardware attached
to the machine, the most useful are: [`lshw`](http://www.ezix.org/project/wiki/HardwareLiSter) (“list hardware”),
[`lspci`](http://linux.die.net/man/8/lspci) (“list PCI devices”) and [`lsusb`](http://linux.die.net/man/8/lsusb) (“list USB
devices”). Some support verbosity flags which make their output more detailed, but the information is quite detailed to start with: for
example `lshw` can display each RAM chip individually along with information such as what slot it is inserted into on the
motherboard.

## Multi-purpose tools <a id="multi-purpose"></a>

### sysdig
There’s a new kid on the block, called [`sysdig`](http://www.sysdig.org/). It offers convenient access to a number of interesting
statistics, some of which would require a bit of shell scripting in order to be extracted using more generic tools. We haven’t fully
evaluated `sysdig` yet, but it looks promising. Expect to find out more about it from another blog post of ours in some time.

## Pseudo-filesystems <a id="pseudofilesystems"></a>

A lot of system information can be accessed on Linux through pseudo-file systems. Theses are structures which appear to be files within the
directory structure, but do not contain files stored on disk but rather gateways to system information made available by the kernel. Most
files in these filesystems are read-only but some can be written to in order to change kernel settings. For example, some files in
`/proc` can be both read and written which can replace the use of [`sysctl`](http://linux.die.net/man/8/sysctl).

### /proc

The [`proc`](http://linux.die.net/man/5/proc) pseudo-filesystem was designed in order to make accessing information about individual
processes more convenient, but over time more unrelated features were added. For each PID there exists a subdirectory `/proc/PID`
with files such as `cmdline`, `cwd` and `environ` which, when read, will provide, respectively, the full command
line, working directory and full set of environmental variables of the process.

Some of the files found in the tree, including `cmdline`, contain values separated by the
[NUL character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character) (`\0`). For viewing or processing with command-line tools,
it may sometimes be more convenient to convert NULs to end-of-line characters using `tr '\0' '\n'`.

The directory `/proc/PID/fd` contains files corresponding to all file descriptors opened by the process. These files appear as
symbolic links, so you can see the contents of these files as the process sees them. You can even use them to rescue a deleted file if
some process still has the file opened. In the case of sockets, the link target will look similar to: `socket:[597684]`.
The number is the [inode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode) number in Linux’s
[virtual filesystem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_file_system), and you can find the same value in the outputs of
`netstat` and `lsof`, thus combining the information provided by different tools. Note that in `netstat`, the socket
may be filtered out e.g. if you used the `-t` option which displays only TCP sockets, and the socket in question is a UNIX-domain
socket.

The file `/proc/PID/smaps` contains very detailed information about the process’s memory layout. You can extract from it
information about memory-mapped files and how big parts of each are currently loaded into memory. A utility called
[`pcstat`](https://github.com/tobert/pcstat) can render this information as easy-to-read text-mode histograms.

The two files `/proc/cpuinfo` and `/proc/meminfo` provide detailed information about available CPU cores and memory usage,
respectively.

The directories `/proc/sys` and `/proc/net` allow reading and tuning of many system parameters which may affect performance.

There are many very interesting things to be found in `/proc` which are outside the scope of this article, but they are certainly
worth a look. Do be careful, however, before trying to modify any settings. Some are really dangerous.

### /sys

One of the reasons for creating [`sysfs`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs) was that over time a lot of information was added to
`/proc` which was not related to the original purpose of providing per-process information. Apart from introducing more order,
`/sys` was also added as a new way of accessing per-device information. Some interesting settings you can control via `/sys`
include getting and setting the I/O scheduler for a drive through `/sys/block/DEV/queue/scheduler` and checking if the drive is
rotational (HDD) or not (SSD) by reading `/sys/block/DEV/queue/rotational`.

Many other performance-related parameters can be retrieved or set via `/sys` — actually tools such as `lshw` often use
`/sys` and `/proc` internally. For an interesting experiment with the tools mentioned in this post, you can use
`strace` to debug how `lshw` works internally, and search the output for uses of `/proc` and `/sys`:

```
strace lshw 2>&1 | egrep '/proc|/sys'
```

## Summary<a id="summary"></a>

Even when writing high-level code, at some point you have to deploy and run it on some hardware or virtual machine. Knowing what is going on
inside an application is crucial to making it stable, fast and predictable. Adding extra logging to your code is not always practical and
sometimes simple tools can be very helpful in monitoring applications or debugging issues on a live system. You can use
[this nice overview](http://www.brendangregg.com/Perf/linux_observability_tools.png) to find out about many additional tools not mentioned
here.

I hope you find this post interesting and a good starting point to learning more.
