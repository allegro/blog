If you are a junior or mid-level engineer, You are probably thinking about the question “How to become a senior?” How much knowledge you have to gain or what
has to be done to become one. Below you can read my insight about it. We will discuss what skills you could develop in order to make more impact on an imaginary
new project. [Lean startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lean_Startup)
There is also a second aspect. Maybe you know people with a “senior” job title, that have much less experience and knowledge than you? You are asking yourself
what the hell is wrong with me? Why am I not a senior? I also asked myself these questions. Everything is fine with you and I will explain it further. It is not
an article about how I became a senior because it is still ahead of me. I will offer some insights about finding your strengths and which development strategy
to choose that helps you be closer to the senior level. There is also one mysterious aspect - which strengths will be valuable for your leader, team, and
company. I will help you decide which ones are the most valuable.

### When to start the development

In order to explain how to choose and develop good skills, imagine that you are working on some product. To create a valuable product you have to gather
customer needs. If not, you will create a product that will be unneeded or ugly. You will not see the disadvantages of this product. For example, you are going
to paint your daughter's room. You can do this without asking her for color. What is the chance that she will love it? You can buy 30 samples and paint a very
little part of the wall. The better solution is to ask her what her needs are and both top 5 colour samples.

Let's treat your main skill as a valuable product. To develop a good product you should meet the expectations of your clients. Who is the client of you as a
product? You? You are certainly a minor stakeholder. Your main stakeholder is your team leader, your team, and the company that you are working in. If you know
the expectations, and you achieve them, you will be very valuable to your company which means a higher level of your career. Expectations are the key.
Expectations differ between companies and even teams.
![Expectations](/img/articles/2021-07-23-become-a-senior/expectations.png)
The status of a senior is difficult to compare between companies and teams. The same person may be a senior at one company and a junior in another. At one
company where I worked the senior was expected to have good knowledge about products and the business and that's why the tenure length was the main factor
there. On the other hand, at another company there was a person with excellent knowledge about the product and business, but she did not carry out large tasks -
and did not take tasks that no one wanted to take, stayed at the less attractive post of a mid-level engineer. In Allegro, we also have expectations for a
senior. There is a list of expectations made by the internal leader's community. Such a list of expectations is a good start to begin the development process
towards a senior. This is where I started my journey, and you should start from a similar place too if you want to focus on developing the skills that have the
greatest impact on your efficiency.

### Assess yourself with some evaluation sheets

To start development, you need to know your current seniority level. I started from two independent evaluation sheets of my skills, one filled in by the leader,
and the other filled in by me. This evaluation sheets for software engineers is divided into 3 parts:

- Technical knowledge
- Attitude
- Product knowledge

Each part has a list of skills with precise description. For instance, one of the descriptions of the skill technical knowledge look like this :

- You know your technological stack very well(systems, applications, languages, tools ) Having a given technical problem you know what are the technological
  abilities, and you know how to use them to achieve your goal.

Each skill needs to be graded from 1 to 5. Seniors will have a couple of skills near 5. After all, we need to calibrate our grades. For example :
I rated myself as 4 in this technical knowledge but my leader rated me as 3 I pointed to a technical stack that I know but my leader showed me that we have some
tools that I haven’t worked on yet like the Cassandra database. So we changed my grade to 3. We calibrated this skill. I discovered the expectations for it. I
can develop the skill if it is valuable for me or my leader. After assessment and calibration, I had good knowledge of the expectations from the senior on each
skill. Now I have to choose which one I will develop to achieve a high score.

### How to choose skills to improve?

There are many strategies for choosing skills to develop. You should combine them to get good results. The first thing is you should have a mentor. It will
almost always be your leader but also it can be another senior. The leaders in Allegro gain knowledge about motivation and performance from many training
sessions. You should find a similar person and ask which skills are valuable for your team and the company. After this preparation, you should have a shorter
list of skills to develop. Now you have to choose 2 or 3 skills that you are going to develop. You can choose them intuitively or by doing some talent tests
like Gallup (CliftonStrengths). Depending on the type of skills that you selected, you should choose a proper path. Let's explain an example of a soft skill
using the Gallup test and a hard skill using the startup approach.

### How Gallup test can help you find activities that improve you

The Gallup [CliftonStrengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/home.aspx) test helps you find the activities that you like to do. It provides
descriptions of 4 main domains. Some of these will have a direct influence on your job the others do not. The main domains are:

- Executing
- Influencing
- Relationship Building
- Strategic Thinking

So aspects, like a description of your character in the relationship building domain, will not help you with our problem. If you are lucky, you may discover
that the things you like to do and your talents are also matched to your client's expectations. Of course, if you know that you can stand on your head it does
not mean that you will instantly do this without any problem. You have to develop this talent to be a good one. Gallup tests only show aspects that you should
develop.
![Gallup](/img/articles/2021-07-23-become-a-senior/gallup.png)

Practical example:
I took the Gallup test and I have a “learner” talent - I like learning and I should share my knowledge. Following the evaluation, the process sheet came out
that I do not share knowledge. I decided to make a presentation about a subject that I know. I prepared a presentation about JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness).
I'm not a good speaker so I signed myself up for training about presentation. After that, I had the subject, knowledge and skills to do this. Estimates for this
project were also achievable. It took me 6 weeks. In the middle of preparing this presentation, I discovered that is not what I have always wanted to do!
I performed this presentation but I had to make a pivot and change the strategy. Maybe writing articles will be a good strategy for knowledge sharing. In this
situation, you have two choices: pivot or persevere. Pivot means to shift to a new strategy. Persevere means you continue to work using the chosen strategy.
Take a look at the second type of skill.

### How startup method can help you develop your skills

Let’s split up hard skills into two groups. In the first group, there are skills that you have to learn by yourself (for example a new programming language ).
You have to be motivated and disciplined to achieve the expected level. The second group has skills that you will acquire automatically (for example framework
used by your team) while you work on a project. If you have to choose a skill from the first group the startup method can be helpful.
![Startup](/img/articles/2021-07-23-become-a-senior/startup.png)

In this context this method can look like this:

1. Choose first skill (order doesn’t matter),
2. Estimate how long you have to learn and put it to your calendar
3. Make some MVP means do this for a while, for example, 2-3 weeks
4. After this time show result to your leader,
5. Learn - Do you enjoy it? Did your leader like it?
6. If not make pivot (choose other strategy or choose next skill) If yes preserve development

In the worst scenario, you will check all your skills. But you will get a lot of knowledge. I never heard the opinion that someone learned something and he
regrets it. In a good scenario, you will find skills that you will like, if not you have to speak with your leader and choose another group of skills. Take a
look at other groups of skills that you develop automatically during your work. You have to ask your leader which strategy will be more valuable for your team:
deep or wide range. Let’s take an example of what is the difference between wide and deep product knowledge:

1. You resolve tasks from your domain only with domain that you like and you are familiar with, you do not take tasks that are new for you - to achieve this
   skill you will probably need a couple of years, but you also have a value - you are making tasks faster
2. You are taking almost always tasks in a new domain for you - you are brave and make tasks with the new language, some new configuration, some new frameworks,
   then you will achieve a high rate in a couple of months, but you will have to gain a lot of knowledge, and you will make this tasks very slow.

If your leader expects to resolve this task fast you have to take the first strategy, if your leader expects to know about all products that you will be a good
partner for business and so on you have to take the second strategy.

### Pivot or persevere

At the end some explanation about a pivot. Pivot means to shift to a new strategy. Let’s take the example of Knowledge sharing. This skill has many strategies:

- making presentation
- writing articles
- making training
- etc

For example, I made a presentation and after getting a feedback, I made a pivot and decided to write an article. Just to check if I like this strategy. This
article is the result of this process. I persevere, and I will continue to work using the chosen strategy.

### Summary

If you want to be a senior you should have a mentor. You should also assess your skills. After assessment and calibration with your mentor, you should choose a
couple of skills and develop them. You can choose a skill using a Gallup test or using a startup method. The major aspect should always be the expectation of
your clients like the leader, team or company. If you choose the wrong skill, don’t worry, make a pivot and choose another one. After a couple of iterations,
you will achieve your target.
