Everyone repeats like a mantra that tests are an indispensable element of development work.  Is there anything to it? 
Well, I need to admit that as a developer, I rather often want to skip the test writing stage. I assume I’m not the 
only one. I’m aware that it’s a mistake, even with testers on board. Effective and efficient testing of your own code
 leads to catching bugs at the moment of creating a functionality, as well as when changing something already existing. 
 It cannot be questioned. Sometimes tests also help to understand how some long—unused functionality or component works. 
 And that’s a small bonus too. **Can a large project cope without testing? Probably so. But the number of errors and 
 their severity will probably be much higher.** That’s why in Allegro Ads we pay attention to writing tests.

## Frameworks
We have a fairly large number of frameworks that are used to write tests in JavaScript. We can list tools like: 
[MochaJS](https://mochajs.org/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io), 
[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Some of them focus more on business value,
 others on technical details. There are also a range of libraries which solve different problems. However, in this 
 article, we will pay special attention and compare two testing javascript libraries like 
 [Enzyme.js](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) (often called RTL).

## EnzymeJS
From the Enzyme documentation we can read a short description: *Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React 
that makes it easier to test your React Components' output. You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways 
simulate runtime given the output.*

Enzyme was released in **2015 by AirBnB**. And let’s face it, Enzyme has gained a lot of popularity. Last year, 
the library was moved from AirBnB space to external github space as a separate independent organization. This step was 
intended to encourage the community to further develop the library.

###### Source [Enzyme github](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme/commit/b06750bb5f6248ceb9c3fae903a71d0747a420d6)

When it comes to raw data, the latest version of **Enzyme 3.11.0** has a bundle size of **463.2kb (127.5 kB)** and was 
released on **20 December 2019**. Currently has 258 [open issues](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme/issues) and 31 
open PR’s.

Interesting fact: 
- There are also Enzyme Adapter Packages for React. So you need to install adapter package and its dependencies related 
to the version of React that you are using. For example, for version 16, it also needs *enzyme—adapter—react—16* to be 
installed. Unfortunately, it does not support all features completely. So for every new version of React, we have to 
wait for the release of the new adapter.

## React Testing Library (often called RTL)

RTL says about itself: *The React Testing Library is a very light—weight solution for testing React components. It 
provides light utility functions on top of react—dom and react—dom/test—utils, in a way that encourages better testing 
practices.*.

Released in **April 2018 by Kent C. Dodds**. The latest stable version **12.1.2** of RTL has a bundle size of 
**215.8kb (47.3 kB)** and was released in **October 2021**. Currently, a pre—release of v13.0.0—alpha is being 
prepared. Repository has 26 [open issues](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme/issues) and 2 open PR’s.

###### Source [Bundle Phobia](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@testing-library/react@12.1.2)


Interesting facts: 
- When you create a project by Create React App, you will get support for React Testing Library right away. 
- Jest documentation links to the RTL website in the [*Testing Web Framework*](https://jestjs.io/docs/testing-frameworks#react)
 section as well as React documentation in the [*Recommended Tools*](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html#tools).
- Testing—library allows us to test with the same API not only React but also others frameworks like Vue 
(testing—library/vue), Angluar (tesiting—library/angular), Svelte (testing—library/svelte) etc. This could be some 
advantage for people working on several projects in different technologies.

## Basic differences

The main differences between the two libraries that I can notice:
1. **Different approaches to testing** 
   
   What distinguishes RTL is that we find elements by their labels or texts, almost like a user would. The point is to 
   replicate and simulate the user’s behavior. Rtl tries to render components to the DOM and doesn’t give us access 
   directly to the internal component. While Enzyme uses shallow rendering (or sometimes deep rendering) and 
   encourages us to test the components instance using their state and props. Enzyme also allows full rendering of DOM 
   but it is not the basic assumption of the library’s operation.
2. **Bundle size** 
   
   Maybe this is not as significant as the first point, but it is worth paying attention to bundle size also. RTL has 
   a two times smaller bundle.
3. **Age**  
   
   Enzyme is 6 years old, RTL is 3 years old

## Comparison of downloads

Below we can see a comparison of the number of downloads of both libraries in the last 5 years. Between August and 
September 2020, the number of RTL downloads exceeded the number of Enzyme downloads.

###### Source [npm trends](https://www.npmtrends.com/@testing-library/react-vs-enzyme)

In the case of RTL, it is clear that the number of downloads is still growing strongly. On the other hand, it can 
be suspected that the highest peak of Enzyme downloads is already behind it.

###### Reasons to change testing library

Well, let’s be honest, Enzyme.js is a powerful library which helps us test our React Components in an easier way for a 
long time. But maybe.. too long? The first official release was in December 2015. Do not get me wrong, I don’t want to 
say that everything old is bad. But the frontend world is changing constantly, just as the approach to testing it. 
I know that the Enzyme.js library hasn’t been deprecated yet, but there are a lot of reasons to switch your test library 
right now. **If you haven’t read it I highly recommend you to take a look at this 
[Piotr Staniów article](https://www.piotrstaniow.pl/goodbye-enzyme)** (it takes about 10 minutes to read). 

The main reasons for me to think about slowly rewriting your tests and switch to another library from this article are: 
- one maintains a developer, 
- not keeping up with React changes. 

I think these are big blockers in using this tool on.

## Case study of rewriting

Below I will present my own example created for the purposes of this article. It should present the minimal effort to 
rewrite one library to another.

### Component: 

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export const Test = ({ defaultCounter = 0, header = 'Default header' }) => {
    const [counter, setCounter] = useState(defaultCounter)
    const increment = () => setCounter(counter + 1)
    const decrement = () => setCounter(counter - 1)

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{header}</h1>
            <p className='counter'>{counter}</p>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment counter</button>
            <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement counter</button>
        </div>
    )
};

export default Test;

```
### Enzyme example: 

```js
import React from 'react';
import { mount } from 'enzyme';

import { Test } from '../Test';

describe('<Test />', () => {
  it('should render default header', () => {
    // when
    const wrapper = mount(<Test />);

    // then
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('Default header');
  });
  it('should render header from props', () => {
    // when
    const wrapper = mount(<Test header="My simple calculator" />);

    // then
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('My simple calculator');
    expect(wrapper.text()).not.toContain('Default header');
  });
  it('should render default defaultCounter', () => {
    // when
    const wrapper = mount(<Test />);

    // then
    expect(wrapper.find('.counter').text()).toBe('0');
  });
  it('should render defaultCounter from props', () => {
    // when
    const wrapper = mount(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);

    // then
    expect(wrapper.find('.counter').text()).toBe('100');
  });
  it('should increment conunter on click', () => {
    // given
    const wrapper = mount(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);
    const button = wrapper.find('button').at(0);

    // when
    button.simulate('click');

    // then
    expect(wrapper.find('.counter').text()).toBe('101');
  });
  it('should decrement conunter on click', () => {
    // given
    const wrapper = mount(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);
    const button = wrapper.find('button').at(1);

    // when
    button.simulate('click');

    // then
    expect(wrapper.find('.counter').text()).toBe('99');
  });
});


```
### What need to be change:
- remove **mount** and use **render** instead
- remove **wrapper** variable and use **screen** to get elements
- replace **simulate(’click’)** with **userEvent**

### React testing library example: 
```js
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

import { Test } from '../Test';

describe('<Test />', () => {
  it('should render default header', () => {
    // when
    render(<Test />);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Default header' })).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  it('should render header from props', () => {
    // when
    render(<Test header="My simple calculator" />);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { name: 'My simple calculator' })).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.queryByText('Default header')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  it('should render default defaultCounter', () => {
    // when
    render(<Test />);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByText('0')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  it('should render defaultCounter from props', () => {
    // when
    render(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByText('100')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  it('should increment conunter on click', () => {
    // given
    render(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);

    const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Increment counter' });

    // when
    userEvent.click(button);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByText('101')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  it('should decrement conunter on click', () => {
    // given
    render(<Test defaultCounter={100} />);

    const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Decrement counter' });

    // when
    userEvent.click(button);

    // then
    expect(screen.getByText('99')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});

```
## Enzyme and RTL in Allegro Ads

My team is currently working on the development of [Allegro Ads](https://allegro.pl/ads), which is an advertising tool 
for our ecommerce platform sellers. It is a whole panel for viewing statistics, displaying advertising campaigns. We 
provide sponsored offers for our allegro site, facebook, google and recently even for on the partner websites. Our 
sellers pay us for the opportunity to advertise their products, and at the same time we strive to ensure that these 
ads accurately reach people potentially interested in buying, thereby generating profits for sellers.

The main technology stack is standard and still pretty cool. The core of the project is written in React, and 
significant parts have been rewritten to Typescript. From the beginning, for testing purposes, we use Jest. In 
my opinion this is a very good and stable tool, easy to work with. It has quite a low entry threshold, even if someone 
hasn’t had too much experience with tests before. The main advantages of Jest for me are minimal configuration and quite 
good documentation. But for testing react components we currently have two libraries and I’ll explain why in a moment.

The 2.0. version of platform Allegro Ads was released about 6 years ago, with an Enzyme library on a board. A year ago 
the team added a react testing library to package.json. We have both packages so far. **Recently we officially decided 
to slowly rewrite the Enzyme library for good.** We added the rule to our docc (Declaration of Code Convention) that 
the new components are tested just in RTL, the old ones will be rewritten when existing parts of the code will be onboard.

## Migration effects so far

Currently we have got **592 test files** (counting after the file names with “spec” phrase). In these files we can 
also find **709 of unique “describe”** usage for wrapping a series of tests, and **1796 unique test cases**. Half of 
tests are written only in jest, but a significant amount of tests for better testing use extra libraries. 

React testing library is used in **131 files**, which is around **22% of all test files**. 
Enzyme tests are in **137 files** which is around **23%**.  

So the Enzyme is still used more often. However, keep in mind that we have been using Enzyme in this project from the 
beginning and RTL for a year. So I’m quite stunned by these numbers. I did not think that the use of RTL would increase
 so significantly in a year. Of course, there is still a long way to completely eliminate Enzyme, especially among 
 other project priorities, but now I’m convinced that small steps will be enough to do that.

## Summary

Hopefully this article showed you that switch from one to the other library doesn’t have to be difficult. As 
programmers, we will encounter such situations frequently. I think that the effort put into replacing old 
libraries with newer ones and keeping your code free of technological debt will bring tangible results for developers, 
project and, finally, users.

I hope that I was able to show you why we prescribe the Enzyme to RTL, how we do it and at what stage we are. Probably 
it is not the end. What are we going to replace RTL with in the future? We’ll see. :)
