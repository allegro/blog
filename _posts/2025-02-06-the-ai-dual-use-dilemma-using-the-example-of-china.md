This article discusses the dual-use dilemma of AI, focusing on China’s approach
and the challenges of balancing innovation with security risks, particularly the
blurred lines between civilian and military applications.

## Introduction

The dual-use dilemma of AI applies to virtually every country that is either
already a superpower or aspires to be one. This article could, in principle,
describe any major player on the international stage. So why China? Firstly,
because its actions are highly visible. Secondly, though perhaps
belatedly, I will try to capitalize on the boom associated with DeepSeek – a
tool which is probably the most apparent manifestation of Chinese ambitions in AI.
Reports of leaked personal databases, chat histories, and other security
vulnerabilities in the DeepSeek application may just as well be only the tip of the iceberg.

## The Changing Cybersecurity Landscape

At the risk of being Captain Obvious, I will start this discussion by stating that 
advances in AI are changing the cyber security landscape dramatically.

The ambitious plans of the Chinese, combined with their military-civilian fusion
strategy, present an explosive mix and a challenge that raises concerns about
the potential misuse of AI technologies, to say the least. This dual-use dilemma
refers to the inherent challenge of balancing the desire to foster innovation
and economic growth with the need to mitigate potential security risks. At the
end of January, [I wrote a few words on Substack about how the European Union is
putting a stick in its spokes](https://bartoszkowalski.substack.com/p/ai-act-we-stay-in-the-tail-of-the?r=5651p8)
by introducing the AI Act in its current form and
at such a moment in history. Regulation is needed, of course. But moral
superiority may not be enough in this day and age.

Many advances in Artificial Intelligence are based on open source research,
international collaboration and the free flow of information. This openness
fosters innovation and accelerates progress, but it also increases the risk of
these technologies falling into the wrong hands. Controlling the dissemination
of knowledge and technology while preserving the benefits of international
cooperation is a major challenge.

## Challenges of Control and Regulation

Imposing strict export controls on AI technologies, in turn, stifles innovation
and economic growth. Such restrictions damage international relations and
provoke retaliation from other countries. Moreover, to indulge in another
truism, it is tough to effectively control the flow of information and
technology in the digital age.

The boundary between civilian, political or even military applications of Artificial
Intelligence has always been blurred. Facial recognition technology, for
example, was initially developed for convenient payment systems and smart city
initiatives, but can be ([and is](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/10/1060982/china-pandemic-cameras-surveillance-state-book/)) easily adapted for mass surveillance or
tracking of individuals of interest. Similarly, AI-based cybersecurity tools
designed to protect critical infrastructure can also be ([and are](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00628-x#:~:text=AI%20algorithms%20can%20analyse%20a,defences%20and%20intrusion%20detection%20systems.)) used to
develop sophisticated cyber-weapons and conduct cyber espionage.

## Blurred Lines: Civilian vs. Military Applications

China’s approach makes it difficult to track technology flows and identify potential 
military applications. Universities and research laboratories may be involved in both 
civilian AI projects and those with potential military applications, making 
it difficult to distinguish between the two.

Widely used in China for convenient payments and smart city initiatives, facial
recognition technology can also be used for mass surveillance, people tracking
and even in autonomous weapons systems. The military could use facial
recognition to identify enemy combatants, high-value targets, and even civilians
in real-time during conflict. In the future, autonomous weapons systems could
use facial recognition to select and attack targets. Analysis of huge datasets
of facial images could be used to identify individuals, track their movements,
and create detailed profiles for intelligence purposes. China’s [social credit
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System), which relies heavily on facial recognition, can de facto be a system of mass
surveillance and social control. This system could easily be adapted for
military purposes.

## Examples of Dual-Use AI in China

While AI can be used to strengthen cybersecurity defences, it also poses new
challenges, such as the “black box” problem of understanding how AI systems make
decisions and identify potential vulnerabilities.

Natural Language Processing (NLP), in turn, can power translation services and customer service, 
but it can also be used to generate deepfakes, spread disinformation, and analyze vast
amounts of textual data to gather intelligence. It can also be used to analyze
vast amounts of textual data, such as social media posts, news articles, and
enemy communications, to extract valuable intelligence. Artificial Intelligence
can be used to analyze public sentiment, identify potential threats, and predict
likely population reactions to political events or military actions. NLP can be
used to generate and disseminate disinformation campaigns, manipulate public
opinion, and sow discord among enemy populations. AI-based tools are already
widely used to create highly realistic deepfakes, including manipulated videos
and audio recordings of political leaders, which can be used for propaganda,
blackmail, and sowing confusion and distrust.

## Data Collection and Its Implications

Artificial Intelligence models are trained on massive datasets. China has a vast
amount of data on its citizens, collected through various means, including
social media, surveillance systems, and government records. Now, through the
release of free apps and open-source tools, they also have data on citizens of
other countries. This data advantage can be used for military purposes, such as
predictive modeling and the development of superior Artificial Intelligence
systems. The collection and use of massive amounts of data raises serious
privacy and data security concerns. The Chinese government could misuse this
data for social control, surveillance, and suppression of dissent. The potential
data breaches and misuse of personal data collected by Chinese companies should
be of concern to people around the world. I write “should” because the
percentage of people who are concerned about what happens to their data is still
too small for us to talk about a breakthrough in the perception of this problem.

## The AI Arms Race

China’s rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence are fuelling an arms race
between major powers. This competition is leading to cyberattacks, the
development of autonomous weapons systems, and increased geopolitical
instability. The rapid development and deployment of AI-based weapons systems
may increase the risk of miscalculation and unintended consequences. 
There will be no single individual to blame. It will simply be decision-makers saying, 
“Oops, accident, the computer made a mistake, but it’s not our fault.” 
The development of AI-based technologies could fundamentally change the balance of power on the
international stage. China’s dominance in Artificial Intelligence could give it
a significant economic and technological advantage, potentially affecting global
trade and economic order. The development of advanced weapon systems based on
Artificial Intelligence could alter the balance of military power, potentially
destabilizing the existing international order. Which, as I wrote earlier, is
what China is aiming for.

## Finding a Solution

I am struggling to find a solution to this situation. No wonder: smarter people
have tried and failed. Introducing more and more new regulations will not stop 
the superpowers from developing AI tools in the way that is forbidden in the EU.
In my opinion it will be quite the opposite – it will further tie the hands of 
entrepreneurs and inventors in the EU and cause a further exodus to countries 
with a more liberal approach to technology. International players who have so far 
failed to comply with EU regulations will continue to do so.

The only solution I see is raising public awareness of the potential risks and
benefits of Artificial Intelligence technologies. Fostering public discourse and
debate on the ethical, social, and political implications of Artificial
Intelligence development is essential. It is also crucial to invest in education
and training programs to equip future generations with the knowledge and skills
necessary to navigate an AI-based future.
