After six years as a Team Leader, I went back to hands-on engineering work, and I'm very happy about taking
this step. While it may appear surprising at first, it was a well-thought-out decision, and actually the second time
already I've performed such a maneuver.

## Why

A few years ago I stumbled upon [The Engineer/Manager Pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/)
by Charity Majors, and the follow-up post [Engineering Management: The Pendulum Or The Ladder](https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/).
I found both pieces very interesting, and quite in line with my own experiences: in my previous job I was a Team Leader,
but consciously joined [Allegro](https://allegro.tech) as a Software Engineer. After a while, I became a Team Leader
again, and another few years down the line, I went back to engineering again.

Both above-mentioned posts make very good points, so I recommend you read them first. What I want to add on top of
them are my personal experience (which may of course be different from yours) and some details on how to organize
a transition between a management and an individual contributor role. The journey in the other direction (from
developer to team leader) is discussed much more, so I won't delve into that.

Why would I want to switch between developer and team leader roles? The problem is they are both interesting and have
their own highlights, but you can't do both at the same time. When you become a manager, you not only have less time
for technical tasks, but you also pretty much lose the ability to focus on those tasks even if you do find a time slot.
This is because, like it or not, you end up with a [manager's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

Over time, your technical skills start deteriorating, and if you miss the right moment, you may find yourself at
a point of no return. So, like a circus artist on a flying trapeze, you have to time your actions right to avoid
disaster. I think this metaphor fits the situation better than that of the pendulum, which moves in its own rhythm,
independent of external influences.

Obviously, you need to ask yourself whether you need your technical skills at all. Some people move on to management,
wave goodbye to doing things with their own hands, and are completely fine with that. Some tinker with technology in
their spare time. You need to decide which type you are. As for me, I like technology and would not only prefer to not
lose what I have learned so far, but would actually want to learn something new. However, due to a number of other
hobbies and already spending more time in front of the screen than I would like, doing tech in the afternoons was not a
viable option for me. Hence, the decision to make technology an important part of my job again.

## How

An important factor to take into account when planning such a change is that it will take time. If you take your
team seriously, you can't just disappear overnight. You need to think ahead. Do not ask yourself "have I already
lost my tech skills beyond repair?". Ask yourself "how will my tech skills be a year from now?".

When I started thinking about making the switch, once I had a rough idea of what I wanted, I talked to my superior.
This was an important step: it allowed him to plan ahead, and also to look for opportunities for making the
reorganization easier. Some elements of the process would depend only on our actions, but some, such as finding a good
replacement team leader, would also depend on a number of factors outside our control. Knowing that my boss understood
my need, and supported it, was important, and made the wait and preparations easier.

Chance favors the prepared mind, as Louis Pasteur is supposed to have said. There happened to be a team leader in
another part of the company who was thinking about moving on to a different area. Thanks to being aware of my plan,
my boss was able to grab the chance, and we had a perfect match. We discussed with the potential new leader the team
and the project, and he found them interesting. We planned a transition period, as short as possible, but long enough
for me to transfer to him a reasonable part of my knowledge about the team and its work.

Now that we had a specific plan, we could tell the team. It was important to let everyone know as soon as possible, but
not before we had a specific plan. Without it, all the information would have done would be stirring uncertainty. Apart
from telling the team as a whole, I also talked to each person individually, in order to resolve any questions or doubts
and to try reducing any problems related to the transition as much as possible.

Waiting for the switch date, we kept meeting online with the new leader, transferring knowledge and preparing him for
working with the new team. There's actually quite a lot of stuff a leader needs to know: not only how the project
works on technical and business levels, but also current plans, who the stakeholders are and how to work with them,
and each team member's individual strengths and development plan. The new leader himself also started meeting
people he would now work with, both team members and our product's stakeholders, and attending team meetings. Despite
gradually moving on to other tasks after the switch date, I was still available to clarify any doubts, so the new leader
knew he would not be left on his own. While it required quite a bit of work, the switch went smoothly, and we didn't
cause any serious disturbance to the team's functioning.

## The Aftermath

It's been several months since the switch now. Me changing back to a technical role has certainly required extra work,
for me, my boss, and the new team leader. Despite our best efforts, it probably put a little extra strain on the team as
well. Nonetheless, I think it was a win-win, even more so thanks to us being able to spot and exploit a happy
coincidence. I am happy to be closer to technology again, and the new leader also got to try something new, just as he
wanted.

There is one more subtle advantage to the whole process. When people leave the team, some knowledge inevitably gets
lost. One of the reasons is, there are always things you know, but are not aware of knowing. You can use this knowledge
when it's needed, but you will probably not transfer it to others because you are not even aware of its existence in the
first place. Removing someone from the team in a controlled manner as happened here (and being still able to reach out
to them if needed) causes such latent knowledge to be discovered, and once discovered, to be propagated. This causes
a little disruption short-term, but in the long run it reduces [knowledge silos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo)
and increases the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).

When I first started thinking about going back to hands-on technical work for the second time, I had some doubts about
how much my technical skills had already deteriorated and how difficult it would be to go back. It seems I made it, but
not by much. Had I delayed by one more year, I might really struggle. It's not a matter of knowledge: theory, especially
generic things that do not change that fast with technology, is not lost so quickly, and while a team leader, I tried
to stay in touch with technology by doing abstract work such as discussing tasks during refinement.

However, I really felt, and to some degree still feel, a difference in applying these skills in practice, e.g. writing
actual code. There are many small quirks that you need to be aware of in order to accomplish things quickly that you
don't even notice if you use them every day and know inside-out. Knowing all the little useful tools, the less often
used features of your IDE, or what to do when something breaks unexpectedly, make a world of a difference, but this
practical knowledge gets lost when not used and I had to rebuild it almost from scratch. Another thing that I still
experience is the difficulty in focusing on a single topic. Working on a manager's calendar for several years has taken
its toll, and now that I often have large contiguous blocks of time, I find myself not using them as effectively as I
could, because I have become accustomed to always doing multiple things at once and without a chance to stay focused
anyway. It's gradually getting better, but I still feel the impact, and this is probably my biggest surprise of the
whole process.

## About the Principal Software Engineer role

My current role is that of Principal Software Engineer (PSE). It is a relatively new one, has gone through a number of
revisions, and is still evolving. Most people in this role come from a Senior Software Engineer background, so my
case of getting there after being a Team Leader is a bit untypical. At many companies, roles like this are called
Staff Software Engineer or similar. While still an individual contributor role, a PSE differs from a senior in several
ways.

First of all, a PSE is expected to spend significant time on topics whose scope is much larger than a single team
handles. Seniors can also do this, but it's not a requirement for them. Such topics may be area-wide, such as planning a
major change to a single subsystem's architecture, or have a company-wide scope. Much work on this level consists of
coming up with ideas and discussing them while implementation is often left to others. So, while still technical, this
role encompasses less coding than that of a senior. Not very surprising given that generally moving up the career ladder
means more coming up with ideas, teaching others, and planning work while coding less yourself.

Second, a PSE should be very autonomous. Most PSEs are not members of regular development teams since they move from
task to task depending on where they can help most. This means you cooperate with more people from different parts of
the company, but you don't have the few peers you work with every day that most people have. You don't get a backlog
of tasks to work on, but have to plan your work yourself. People do come to you, asking for support or doing something
for their project, but that's just one of many inputs.

Third, since there are few PSEs compared to other positions (about 20 out of 2000 people in technology at the moment),
for each person the role is a little different. On one hand, this means you can't fully know what to expect when you
start in this role. On the other, this is because to a large degree you can shape the role yourself, and personally I'm
very happy about this flexibility.

## Summary

I think the idea of switching back and forth between engineering and management described in
[The Engineer/Manager Pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/),
is valid, and my own experience backs it up fully. One element which I want to additionally stress, however, is that
the switch is more like a flying trapeze than a pendulum: timing is crucial, and missing the right moment can have
serious consequences. Becoming a Principal Software Engineer was a very interesting experience, both on a technical
level and as my de facto last task as a Team Leader. Who knows what the future holds? Perhaps some time from now I'll
take another swing on the flying trapeze and go back to management?
