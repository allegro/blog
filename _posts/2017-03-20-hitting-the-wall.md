Running
[Mesosphere](https://mesosphere.com/)
[Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/)
is like running... a marathon. When you are
preparing for a long distance run, you’ll often hear about
[Hitting the wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall).
This effect is described mostly in running and cycling but affects all
endurance sports. It happens when your body does not have enough glycogen to
produce power and this results in a sudden “power loss” so you can’t run
anymore. At [Allegro](https://allegro.tech)
we have experienced a similar thing with Mesosphere Marathon. This
is our story on using Marathon in a growing microservice ecosystem, from tens of
tasks and a couple applications, to thousands of tasks and over a hundred applications.
If there is no mention of Marathon version, it is 1.3.10 and below; we need
some time to test and deploy the latest 1.4 release.
If you are interested in how our ecosystem is built, take a look at below MesosCon
presentation.

## History
A couple of years ago we decided to completely change the architecture of our system.
We used to have a monolithic application written in PHP with a bunch of maintenance
scripts around it. Changing this system was not easy, and what matters the
most, not fast enough for our business to grow. We decided to switch to
the microservice based architecture. This switch required changing our infrastructure and
the way we operate and maintain our applications. We used to have one application and
now we wanted to move to many small applications that could be developed, deployed,
and scaled separately. In the beginning, we tried to launch applications in
dedicated VMs, but it was neither efficient in terms of resource allocation nor
fast or agile, so we searched for a different solution to this problem.
When we began our journey to microservices and containers, there were not so
many solutions on the market as there are today. Most of them were not matured
and not battle-proven. We evaluated a couple of them and finally, we decided to use
[Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/) and
Marathon as our main framework. Below is the story of our scaling issues with
Marathon as our main (and so far only) framework on top of Apache Mesos.
Below image is a snapshot of a traffic visualization for our services.

## Problems

### JVM
Marathon is written in Scala and runs on the Java Virtual Machine.
Take a look at GC and heap usage metrics
and if you see Marathon spends a lot of time in GC or you can’t see a saw shape on
your heap utilization graph, check your GC and heap settings.
There are many talks and tutorials on
tuning a JVM.

### Zookeeper
Marathon uses [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/)
as its primary data storage.
Zookeeper is a key-value store focused
more on data consistency than availability. One of the disadvantages of Zookeeper is that it
doesn’t work well with huge objects. If stored objects are getting bigger,
writes take more time. By default, a stored entry must fit in 1 MB. Unfortunately
Marathon data layout does not fit well with this constraint. Marathon saves
information about deployment statuses
as old application group, deployment metadata and updated group
[MARATHON-1836](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/MARATHON-1836).
That means if you deploy a new
application, deployment will use twice as much space as your application’s group state. In small
installations it’s not a problem
(until some of them leak [MARATHON-1724](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/MARATHON-1724)),
but when you have more and more
applications, over time you will notice your Zookeeper write times take longer and
at some point you will end up with the following error:

```shell
422 - Failed to deploy app [/really/important/fix] to [prod].
Caused by: (http status: 422 from https://production).
RESPONSE: [{
  "message":"Object is not valid",
  "details":[{
    "path":"/",
    "errors":[
      "The way we persist data in ZooKeeper would exceed the maximum ZK node
      size (1024000 bytes). You can adjust this value via --zk_max_node_size,
      but make sure this value is compatible with your ZooKeeper ensemble!
      See: http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.1/zookeeperAdmin.html#Unsafe+Options"
    ]
  }]
}]
```

This error will be thrown by Marathon when you want to deploy a critical fix
([Murphy’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law) works perfectly).
This was a huge problem until Marathon 0.13, but now Zookeeper compression is
turned on by default.
It generally works well, but still, it’s not unlimited, especially if your
app definitions do not compress well. So if they don’t you will hit a wall.
Marathon 1.4.0 brings [a new persistent storage layout](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/master/changelog.md#new-zk-persistent-storage-layout)
so it might save you.

Another issue with Zookeeper, like with any other high consistency storage, is the network delay
between nodes. You really want to put them close to each other and to create a backup cluster
in another zone/region to switch quickly in case of an outage. Having cross-DC
Zookeeper clusters causes long write times and often
[leader reelection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_election).

Zookeeper works best if you minimize the number of objects it stores. Changing
`zk_max_version` (deprecated) from default 25 to 5 or less will save some space.
Be careful with this if you often scale your applications because you can hit
[MARATHON-4338](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/MARATHON-4338)
and lose your health check information.

### Metrics
[Marathon 0.13](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/releases/tag/v0.13.0)
was one of the biggest releases of Marathon. It brought many
improvements and bugfixes. It also brought metrics collection and sending them to
[Graphite](http://graphiteapp.org/) and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). This is nice.
Unfortunately, soon we started having problems with CPU usage on our Marathon cluster.
We profiled it with
[Honest Profiler](https://github.com/RichardWarburton/honest-profiler/wiki)
and it turned out that Marathon was spending 20% of its time on
metrics collection. By default metrics are collected every 10s so we changed this
to 55s and reduced time spent on collection to less than 2%.
Below you can see a [flame graph](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html)
presenting how much CPU time every method takes.
You can compare how much CPU time gathering metrics takes with interval set to
10 seconds (left) and 55 seconds (right).

![Flame graph with default metrics setting](/assets/img/articles/2017-03-20-hitting-the-wall/flame_before_after.png)

### Threads
Marathon uses Akka as an actor framework. Its
configuration suggests that there should be
[64 threads in akka pool](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/v1.3.10/src/main/scala/mesosphere/marathon/Main.scala#L100)
and [100 threads in IO pool](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/v1.3.10/src/main/scala/mesosphere/util/ThreadPoolContext.scala#L8).
This configuration seems valid. When our cluster grew and
we were having more and more applications, we noticed that thread number also
increased. With 2k tasks we had up to 4k threads. This is quite a lot and
we lost precious CPU time on task switching. After weeks of hard work we managed
to reduce this number to 200 threads and our changes
[were merged](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/pull/4912)
and released in [1.3.7](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/releases/tag/v1.3.7).
Still, it’s more than the configured value but we will be able to handle this.
Below you can see a diagram presenting how number of threads decreased after
updating Marathon.

![Marathon threads](/assets/img/articles/2017-03-20-hitting-the-wall/marathon_threads_1.png)

Another optimization we introduced was to increase
`akka.default-dispatcher.throughput` to 20. According to
[the docs](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/dispatchers.html)
this setting will make actors operate on batches of messages.

> Throughput defines the maximum number of messages to be
> processed per actor before the thread jumps to the next actor.
> Set to 1 for as fair as possible.

This is a double-edged sword. Too low a value will totally decrease performance
because of actor switching and CPU cache flushes resulting from context switches.
On the other hand, too
high a value could cause actor starvation and timeouts. We increased it 4 times
and saw a small improvement.

### Healthchecks
Marathon has had HTTP health checks from the beginning, before they were introduced in
Mesos. Each of our tasks have a configured HTTP healthcheck. Because Marathon makes
requests from a single machine — the currently leading master — it’s quite
expensive, especially when you need to make thousands of HTTP requests. To reduce
the load we increased the Marathon health check interval. Fortunately in the
meantime Mesos incorporated HTTP health checks and they were added to Marathon
[1.4](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/releases/tag/v1.4.0),
so soon we can switch and make checks locally on agents.
There is a great post on
[Mesos Native HTTP healtchecks](https://mesosphere.com/blog/2017/01/05/introducing-mesos-native-health-checks-apache-mesos-part-1/).
You can read there that Marathon checks work up to 2k tasks while Mesos scales well.
If you want to switch to Marathon 1.4 and use Mesos healthchecks keep in mind
it’s a new mechanism and there are issues with it:
[MESOS-6786](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6786),
[MESOS-6790](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6790).

### Events
Marathon allows two ways of event subscription. HTTP callbacks
([deprecated from 1.4](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/MARATHON-2378))
when events are pushed to a subscriber with HTTP POST and
[Server-sent events (SSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events), and when the
subscriber makes a connection and retrieves the events. Since
callbacks look easier from a developer perspective we created services using
this method. It’s just a regular web application accepting POSTs. First problem
is the size of events. They could be big (our biggest event is nearly 10 MB — see
[MARATHON-4510](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/MARATHON-4510)).
For example deployment events
contain the whole deployment object — this means the whole Marathon application state
before and after deployment, and steps that will be performed by Marathon
in order to complete it.
Another drawback with callbacks is that events can’t be filtered, so filtering needs to be
done on subscriber side. This is a waste of CPU and network resources, because events need
to be serialized to JSON and then parsed back, only to be eventually dropped.
Currently Marathon spends most of it’s time on parsing events. We added
[filtering by event type](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/d408ef6abeea1e0d06de1d568c6f2cc79e90328a/docs/docs/event-bus.md#filtering-the-event-stream)
to SSE and moved to this subscription.

Another problem with subscriptions is that they are an asynchronous way of
communication. We are currently using them in
[marathon-consul](https://github.com/allegro/marathon-consul)
but we see it’s not the best way of registering services in discovery service.
Due to JSON
parsing and sending, subscriptions performance is sensitive to CPU and network load. When
many deployments are triggered at the same time we experienced lagging events
for a couple of minutes. The following graph presents typical events delay for one of
our cluster in a typical workday. Below you can compare unfiltered callbacks,
and filtered SSE events delay. Data was gathered with marathon-consul.

![Marathon events delay](/assets/img/articles/2017-03-20-hitting-the-wall/marathon-consul.png)
![Marathon events delay (SSE)](/assets/img/articles/2017-03-20-hitting-the-wall/marathon-consul-sse.png)

Our solution to this problem is to create a custom executor
that will register an application in our systems just like Aurora does. This will
give us necessary blocking features on actions that are critical and could not
be done asynchronously. Unfortunately there is an issue with custom executor
support and it looks like nobody is using it
[MARATHON-4210](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/MARATHON-4210).

### Deployments
At a company with over 600 developers located in one timezone,
multiple deployments occur at the same time. This is a problem for Marathon
since it must update the state in Zookeeper and this blocking operation sometimes times out.
If you can try
to group deployments and send them in one batch, then Marathon will work.
Instead of sending many request (one for each application), send one requests
with an array of applications to be deployed.
This solution is not perfect, for example you can’t stop or rollback the deployment
of a single application in a batch so we didn’t introduce such a feature yet.
By the way, stopping an application is dangerous
[MARATHON-2340](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/MARATHON-2340).

### Autentication and Authorization
Marathon has a plugin module that allows adding custom fine-grained authentication
and authorization. Do not use it. We tried and we failed. Its API changes with every
release. But what is more, the API only allows checking permissions for
a single application in one request.
This means that if you have thousands of applications and you want
to query `/v2/apps`, Marathon will call your plugin thousands of times, and then
render a response with only the applications you can see.

Instead of using this plugin, create a facade that will authenticate requests and
remove from them any data users should not see.

### Sharding
If you feel like your installation could grow and want to be
prepared, think about sharding.
You can run many Marathon instances on a single Mesos cluster.
What is more, you can run Marathon on Marathon (MoM).
[Here](https://wiki.mesosphere.com/display/DCOS/MoM+1.4) is a test for it and
[here](https://github.com/mesosphere/universe/tree/version-3.x/repo/packages/M/marathon/8)
you can find a [DCOS](https://dcos.io/) package for Marathon.
With this setup you can mitigate most of the issues described above, by reducing load
on a single Marathon instance.

### Community and support
Community around Marathon is pretty small, especially when compared with
Kubernetes or Docker. Container orchestration is still emerging and not many
people are involved in this project.
If you have a problem you can submit an
[issue](https://jira.mesosphere.com/projects/MARATHON),
ask on
[the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/marathon-framework)
or
[stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/marathon).
But do not expect a fast answer.

Marathon team is small and needs to work on Mesosphere’s paying clients.
This means less important features or community requests will not have much attention.

Being a business client does not necessarily mean you will have proper support or
documentation.

If you want to monitor what is happening with Marathon codebase prepare for
frequent changes. Over the years the Marathon team tried different code review
and management tools. They started with vanilla Github, then moved to Waffle.io
to finally settled on JIRA. For code review they used Github, reviewable.io
and now they prefer [phabricator](https://phabricator.mesosphere.com/).
Their CI system also changed from Travis thru TeamCity to Jenkins.

Overall, it is easier to monitor what happens with Marathon than it used to be
when Mesosphere worked [in a private repo](https://twitter.com/airburst/status/743439711851642884)
and had a [silence period](https://twitter.com/kamilchm/status/741261802487611392)
with no communication to the community. Still, there is no roadmap but you can figure
out what will happen based on Mesos and Marathon issues and pull requests.

## Summary
To sum up, Marathon is a nice Mesos framework for installations of a few thousand applications.
If you
have more than a few thousand applications and more then 10k tasks you will hit the
wall.

### How to avoid the wall:


<iframe height="315"  width="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9lzOCVpvcpg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></div>

1. Monitor — enable metrics but remember to configure them.
2. Update to 1.3.10 or later.
3. Minimize Zookeeper communication latency and object size.
4. Tune JVM — add more heap and CPUs :).
5. Do not use the event bus — if you really need to, use filtered SSE, and accept it is
asynchronous and events are delivered at most once.
6. If you need task life cycle events, use a custom executor.
7. Prefer batch deployments to many individual ones.
8. Shard your marathon.

If this still does not help
try [Aurora](https://aurora.apache.org/).
It has fewer features and slower development but is battle tested
[on huge capacity at Twitter](https://youtu.be/nNrh-gdu9m4)
and more stable than Marathon.
If you need a bigger community, support from more than one company and
faster development try [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Whatever way you choose remember:
