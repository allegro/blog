>_“One picture is worth more than a thousand words.”_

As a passionate process mapper, I am convinced that Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the key to understanding the analysis and
optimization of business processes. I resonate deeply with the idea mentioned at the beginning of this article, and I believe that graphical 
visualization using BPMN allows for clear representation of processes, making it easier for all participants to understand, regardless of their 
role within the organization. I love that “Aha” moment when process participants discover and share knowledge about the process, leading to 
synergy and better understanding among both business and technical teams.

## BPMN: Basics and Functions

BPMN is a standard graphical notation language that enables the depiction of business processes in a way that is understandable to all stakeholders. 
Using graphical elements such as tasks, events, decision gateways, and flows, BPMN allows for the precise definition of the sequence of actions, 
resources, and the role of each participant in the process.
Here is a simple sample having in mind that in real life maps are much more complex.

## Benefits from a Broader Perspective
Mapping processes with BPMN brings numerous benefits to organizations. First, it enables a better understanding and analysis of business processes, 
leading to improved communication and collaboration between different departments. In my opinion, it should always be the first step before 
undertaking actions aimed at optimizing, standardizing, and automating business processes. Moreover, it helps identify those responsible for 
processes, as well as define the participants and the dependencies between them. Overall, process management aims to increase awareness and 
improve process efficiency within the company, which is a priority for every organization.

## Updating Maps: Processes in Constant Motion
However, it is essential to remember that business processes are dynamic and continuously changing. Creating a process map is only the 
first step. Unfortunately, these maps require regular updates to reflect the actual state of processes and continue to serve as a tool 
for understanding, analysis, and optimization.

## Synergy with Event Storming
Event Storming, as described in this [article](https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/07/event-storming-workshops.html), 
is also close to my heart because the similarity between BPMN process mapping and Event Storming is undeniable. Both approaches emphasize 
communication and knowledge sharing, leading to better understanding and effective optimization of processes. The difference lies in the 
fact that Event Storming focuses on an interactive workshop, while BPMN offers a specific process notation. From my experience, these two 
worlds can be combined. To retain the knowledge discovered in Event Storming workshops, I suggest documenting the process in BPMN notation, 
which serves as an excellent material for further work on process optimization or spreading knowledge about it further. The importance of 
open communication and preventing knowledge loss is elaborated [here](https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/10/battle-against-knowledge-loss.html).
Below my comparison of BPMN and Event Storming:

## Process Mining: Immersion in the Process
Process Mining is a technique for process analysis that naturally complements BPMN process mapping. By using real data, such as process 
logs from various systems, Process Mining allows us to see how processes actually unfold in practice. Moreover, we can use a Conformance 
Checker to compare our desired process model (or how we think it goes), presented through a BPMN map, with actual behaviors and deviations. 
This enables organizations to identify areas for optimization and improvement, monitor compliance with established standards, and respond 
to changes in the business environment.

## Summary
BPMN, along with Process Mining and Event Storming, are tools that allow for a better understanding of business processes. They are the key 
and the beginning of something more, namely, a process management approach within companies. Through this, organizations can gain a deeper 
understanding of their processes, identify areas for improvement, respond to changes in the business environment, and strive for efficiency 
improvements at every level of operation.
